If I remember correctly (Which is always in doubt), Horner's signing
with the Braves was contingent on starting in Atlanta.  I think
he could have gone back to Arizona St. for one more year if he hadn't
signed.  Anyhow, the Braves did try to send him to Richmond once;
it lead to a week-long walkout.  Methinks Horner had no work ethic
before he was drafted, and minor league play wouldn't have helped.
But his raw talent would have gotten him into the ML, and it did
keep him there for a while, until he started falling on his wrists.

I think Murray has done a great job.  He's picked up Ciccarelli,
Sheppard, Ysebaert, Howe, Coffey, and Riendeau (plus some depth players) 
without giving up anything the Wings needed or any of his top prospects.
All of this in three years.  Has anyone done better?

The year before he took over, the Wings didn't even make the playoffs.
There was about a year and a half during Demers' stint that the Wings
did OK, but that was due to Demers' motavational skills and clutch
and grab style.  They didn't have much talent.

Gerald, Murray wasn't responsible for Primeau (although I'm not
ready to admit that's a horrible pick).  They hired him after the
draft (which has never made sense to me).  His first pick was
Lapointe.

From where I come from in Canada, Borshevsky sounds more Canadian than
Smith! -)

Anyways, crawl back into the hole you crawled out of...the NBA doesn't
care where they get basketball players from, major league baseball
doesn't give a damn where they get baseball players from (except Cuba,
that is).

Canada is in no imminent danger of being overtaken as the primary 
supplier of players...Sweden, Finland, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia
are all relatively small countries, and cannot really produce players
at a greater rate than they are already producing them, and the
potential influx from the former Soviet Union is severely blunted
because the system has been raided and is starved for finances and
will take a decade or two, to recover and become a real threat, and
the US will just maintain its slow increase.  Canada should continue
to supply 60% plus of the top hockey players in the world for the
forseeable future.

Besides we need the European hockey market if hockey is to take
its rightful place besides soccer as the two predominant world
sports...and since soccer is essentially boring, unlike hockey.


Canadians are under no threat...the European numbers will soon saturate,
if they haven't already...and by the time Russia comes online again,
the NHL should be a world league, and there will be many more teams
to stock and many more jobs for Canadian hockey players.  In the near
team, the percentage of Canadians will mostly decline because of 
Americans, not because of Europeans.

Wales Conference, Adams Division, Semifinal

I'm hoping for a Fuhr miracle, but I agree that Boston will likely win the
series.  Goaltending is about equal, top offensive players are about equal
(Mogilny-LaFontaine vs. Oates-Juneau), but Buffalo has no answer to Neely
(not to imply that Neely is not a top offensive player btw, in fact he's one
of my favourites even though he's a damn Bruin :) ).  And the rest of the
matchup wrt lineup favours Boston anyway.  But I think it will go six.


Agreed here...but Montreal will be pushed to the limit.  Is it just me, or
does everything Montreal does in the playoffs come down to Roy?  Go Habs!!

Final

I can't predict a Montreal victory because I've been watching them play for
6 weeks and IMO they severly need some tougher players, especially to play
in the Garden.  Last time they beat the B's 5-2 but Boston had a clear
territorial advantage; the victory was Roy's.  At the same time, I can't
bring myself to predict the possibility of a loss, so I'll just say I will
not be putting money on this series. :-)



Agreed.  NY doesn't have the goaltending to stop the onslaught, independent
of the trouble they have given Pittsburgh this year.  Pens in five, which is
credit to NY.


Agreed here too, but I think it will go at least six.  Jersey has a decent
team, and Washington has done poorly against the division this year.


I think they will use Tabaracci more after Beaupre gets shelled.  I don't
think it will go six either...*maybe* five.


If Pittsburgh plays Boston, IMO they win in likely five, possibly six.  They
own the Bruins.  If they play Montreal, I think it will go to seven, and once
again I won't be putting money on the seventh game.  I say seven because the
Habs have played Pittsburgh very tough this season.



Chicago will win, but I think in at least six.  Chicago is not that good,
IMO.  And remember that they take ridiculous numbers of penalties.


Very true.  The Leafs have much to be proud of, but they will soon find out
why Montreal did so lousy in the playoffs.  Toronto might win two or three 
at MLG though.  Wings in six, maybe even seven.


It _will_ be a war...possibly the most intense playoff series of them all. 
And yes, I think Detroit will win.  Probert will have to come up big though.



Our first disagreement.  Canucks are playing like shit.  They don't use their
size *at* *all*, which may explain why they get hammered 8-1 by a team
chasing them (Calgary)....Winnipeg in six.


This is also tough for me to call, because I haven't seen the Smythe enough. 
I don't think Roberts will be well enough to figure in, Coffey is a
non-issue, who cares what Carson has done before, and *never* underestimate
Gretzky.  LA in six.


If it is these two, Calgary will not need six games.  But I think it will be
LA-Winnipeg anyway, and LA in seven, because of home ice.


Wow, must've been tough to go against your team.  But let's see, I picked
LA-Detroit.  Detroit will win, probably in six.


If Pittsburgh plays Detroit, it will go longer than five, and I wouldn't bet
against the Wings.  They are very strong, IMO, and nobody knows *how* strong
because they've been underachieving most of the year.  If forced to choose,
though, I'd have to take the Penguins.

A side note.  Vlad, last week you said that Selanne was a better player than
Gilmour.  NO WAY.  He is a more talented pure goal scorer...but aside from
the age difference, there is no way I would take him over Gilmour on my team.
I'm not asking for flames, either, btw....I've spent more than enough time
arguing on behalf of Selanne and I still say he's a great player.  But while
he and Gilmour are both dangerous offensively (give Teemu an edge),
Gilmour *does* *it* *all*.  I know a lot of Gilmour-bashing goes on, esp.
from Flame fans.  But IMO you guys are letting your dislike of Gilmour cloud
your judgement when it comes to his skill.  He is easily one of the best
all-round players in the NHL.

best team in the league.

I've been saying that for at least 2 years now and even the A's conditioning
guru told Jose he was carrying too much weight and losing some would help
his back.Although I don't for one second believe Jose used steroids,his
back problems are very similar to problems alot of steroid users experience
because they are simply carrying too much weight on their frame(see Jeff
Bregel ex 49er as a textbook example), and IMHO Jose is too big for his
frame.



I can't imagine how to estimate bat speed, but its pretty obvious that
Jose is missing fastballs he used to hit, likely due to his back.



I don't know, he had an even more open stance when he first came up with
the A's, and had no problems with it then. It might be that pre-back
problems, he was quick enough to cover up any deficiencies the stance
caused, but now he's lost just enough bat speed that the stance hurts
him. The old saying if you're hot its a trigger mechanism, if you're
cold, its a hitch. 


The biggest problem IMHO is he never has found a stance he's comfortable
with for more than a few months. He changes his stance so much, he loses
track of where the strike zone is. In Wednesday's night game, he was 
clearly mad at strike calls on both corners that looked pretty good to
me. I think he no longer knows where the strike zone really is because
he's changed his stance so much.

I'm also a bit concerned that because he's got Palmer and Gonzalez hitting
all the homeruns, he'll become competitive, swing even harder and screw
himself up even worse. LaRussa always said that Canseco's famous batting
practice homer shows did him more harm than good as they encouraged
bad hitting habits.

In the post game interview (on WJR radio in Detroit), Sparky Anderson said
its one of the few times he's gotten emotional in his managing career.  It
was a big moment for him, and I'm sure all of us Tiger fans are unanimously
very happy for him.  And what a way to get number 2,000!.

As I recall, the author of the _original_ article that started the thread
claimed that he disliked the changing of the names for a variety of reasons. 
Roger, on one front you flamed him rather severely on the grounds that his
was a ""jingoistic rant"", but you also supported the name-changing on the
grounds that the current names are inappropriate because of the individuals
they represent. FWIW, I do not think the flaming was warranted, nor do I 
think you enhanced what credibility you have with it at all.  Just an 
observation...

However, that aside, the real question is whether you like the idea of
changing the names based on the reasons given for it (making it easier for
the 'casual fan'), or whether you like the idea of unique divisional names
based on individuals who do deserve the honour.  IMO, the latter is a nice
and unique touch that differs from other sports.  In addition, I do not
think that changing divisional names will have an effect on the number of
people that are interested in hockey, so it's a pointless exercise anyway.

If the current names are inappropriate, then that is a separate issue, not 
central to the original article.  Something to consider additionally is
whether or not players like Orr who 'contributed to the glory of the sport'
would have been able to do so _without_ an organized professional league to
play in.  In this case, honouring builders of the _league_ as opposed to
builders of the _sport_ becomes a chicken-and-egg type question. (although
it was the chicken.....)


Dunno if the Stein comparison is justifiable, since it doesn't look as though
his 'unanimous acceptance' to the Hall will hold up.

It seemed pretty conclusive to me.  The puck clearly hit the crossbar
and then came down on the line.  And the announcers, admittedly homers,
kept harping about how they ""must have had a different view upstairs""
because it was obvious to them, and, I would have thought, to anyone who
saw the replay, that the puck didn't go in.  The referee originally 
signalled no goal but the video replay ""judges"" initiated contact with
the referee to claim that a goal was in fact scored.  This, to me, is
unheard of.  Seeing stuff like this happen gives me a bad feeling about
the Leaf chances this year.

First, I enjoyed reading your post.  Second, I disagree with the Pen's weak
spot being defense and goaltending - for a couple of reasons.  Barrasso has
had a spectacular year - no slow start, consistently sharp, GAA < 3.0, and 
leads the league in wins.  Tommy deserves the Vezina.  Given the lack of 
respect he commands, though, I doubt he will win it.  The other reason 
concerns the Pens' team defense.  They are hovering around 3rd or 4th in the
fewest goals allowed.  That is a big improvement for them, and it indicates
that they are playing better team defense.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 Sweden opened the scoring as Markus Naslund made a drop pass at the Finnish
 blue line, Popovic picked it up and advanced towards the Finnish goal and
 shot a nice hard wrist shot in Ketterer's top corner. Ville Siren's slap
 shot from the blue line on power play made it 1-1, and Juha Riihijarvi
 scored a nice goal in another power play when he close in front of goal
 put the puck high over Aslin, 1-2 after the first period.
 The Finns started the second period with really good pressure. Korpisalo
 made it 1-3 with another goal from close range high over Aslin. Then,
 during the Finnish pressure, Sweden turned the game around in 1:47.
 Mikael Renberg worked hard behind the Finnish goal, and passed the puck to
 Jan Larsson in front, who backhanded the puck low, 2-3. Rundqvist entered
 the Finnish zone and passed to Ahlund, and the Finnish defense let Ahlund 
 skate in and take a shot that Ketterer dropped into the goal, 3-3.
 Next, Roger Hansson -behind the goal- sent the puck back to the blue line
 where Roger Akerstrom took a slap shot and Ketterer didn't see the puck since
 there was traffic in front, 4-3.
 Third period started with a nice goal by Stefan ""the Shadow"" Nilsson. Stefan
 and Patrik Juhlin entered the Finnish zone, Patrik passed the puck back to
 Stefan who alone with Ketterer made no mistake, 5-3.
 Then, Keijo Sailynoja show started. He reduce and equalized the lead in only
 21 seconds! First he scored the 5-4 goal, and after that he came in alone 
 with Aslin but was tripped by Aslin to get a penalty shot. Sailynoja
 made a nice penalty shot, showed forehand and put in with a low backhand shot.
 The Swedes seemed to head for a win when Mikael Renberg scored the 6-5 goal
 late in the game on a nice power play combination. Renberg waited in the slot,
 showed that he wanted the puck on the backhand side, Ahlund passed the puck
 and Renberg took a turnaround shot low in Ketterer's goal's far side.
 But Jari Korpisalo had other plans as he only 28 seconds later scored the
 game's final goal to make it 6-6. Korpisalo took a slap shot from a narrow
 angle that -maybe- Aslin should have saved.

 All in all, a decent game where the defense wasn't the best.
 Both teams juggled around the lines a bit in the second and third period
 to try no combinations.

 Renberg and Rundqvist plays well together in the Swedish team. Larsson-
 Nilsson-Juhlin best line overall again, it seems to be a working WC line.
 Stillman good on defense.
 Some players aren't good enough for the WC though. Hakan Ahlund (faell ner
 hjaelmen och jobba!), Roger Hansson, Challe Berglund, Kenny Jonsson
 will likely have to leave for NHL pros.

 Two-goal scorers Jari Korpisalo and Keijo Sailynoja played well in the
 Finnish team. Markus Ketterer didn't have a very good game, we've seen him
 a lot better, so Lindfors is probably Finland's starting goalie in the WC.
 I heard that Esa Tikkanen will join the Finnish team. It would be inter-
 resting to know which other pros coach Matikainen counts on for the WC.

"Well here it goes...my crazy predictions (which never come true, but hey..)

Adams
	Bos vs. Buf - Bos in 5 (cakewalk for the hot Bruins)
	Que vs. Mon - Que in 6 (best series of the first round)

Patrick
	Pit vs. NYI - Pit in 5 (NYI wins fourth game)
	Was vs. NJD - NJD in 7 (a grueling upset, possibly OT in game 7)

Norris
	Chi vs. StL - Chi in 5 (StL is no match for Keenan's Krew)
	Det vs. Tor - Tor in 6 (Clark steps it up in playoffs this year)

Smythe (who cares?)
	Van vs. Win - Win in 7 (so I'm caught up in Teemu-mania, sue me!)
	Cal vs. LAK - Cal in 5 (LA sucks!!!!!!!!! IMO)

Division finals
	Bos vs. Que - Bos in 7 (killer games, watch for Cam to shine)
	Pit vs. NJD - Pit in 6 (NJD go insane, kill all on ice, but Pit wins)
	Chi vs. Tor - Tor in 7 (Tor defense finally get it together)
	Cal vs. Win - Cal in 6 (Win too tired after 1st series)

Conference finals
	Pit vs. Bos - Bos in 6 (Pit too beat up by NJD to play (I hope))
	Cal vs. Tor - Tor in 6 (Vernon turns into a sieve)

Stanley Cup
	Bos vs. Tor - Tor in 7 (Two totally different teams, who knows? Dreams
				can come true, pig might one day evolve wings)

Do you really have *that* much information on him?  Really?


I don't know.  You tell me.  What percentage of players reach or 
exceed their MLE's *in their rookie season*?  We're talking about
1993, you know.


If that were your purpose, maybe.  Offerman spent 1992 getting 
acclimated, if you will.  The Dodgers as a team paid a big price
that season.  Perhaps they will reap the benefits down the road.
Do you really think they would have done what they did if they
were competing for a pennant?


For a stat-head, I'm amazed that you put any credence in spring
training.  Did you notice who he got those 10 (!) hits off of, or
are you going to tell me that it doesn't make a difference?


Wait a minute.  I missed something here.  First, forget Keith
Mitchell.  Are you saying that a kid who moves from AA to AAA
and then does not improve would have been better off making a
direct leap to the majors?  If a player does well at AA and then
does not improve at AAA, isn't that a sign that maybe he doesn't
belong in the bigs?

Now, Keith Mitchell.  As I recall (no stat books handy - surprise!)
he jumped from AA to Atlanta in 1991.  He did so well that he was
returned to the minors, where he didn't do very well at all.  Now
his career is in jeopardy.  So how does he fit in with your 
point.  Good MLE's in AA.  Moved him right to the big club.  Now
he's one step away from being traded or moved out of baseball.
Duh.



Well, I've cast my lot.  Certainly you may understand better how 
good Lopez is.  And I may overvalue experience.  But neither one
of us runs a baseball team.

Not any more the rules don't say that.  So that's a pretty dumb argument.

"True rumor.  Fact!  A big three way deal!

Eric Lindros going to Ottawa Senators.  And Senators get $15mill from
Montreal.

Montreal gets Alexander Daigle (the first round pick from Senators)

Philly gets Damphousse, Bellow, Patrick Roy and a draft pick.
",sports
"
This was (my opinion) the stupidest thing in the Hidden Game. The
argument was

1) Defense, or runs allowed, is 50% of the game.
2) Unearned runs amount to 12% of the runs allowed; earned runs, 88%.

3) Since unearned runs are the result of fielding, not pitching, and
earned runs are the product of pitching, not fielding, fielding is 12%
of defense and pitching is 88% of defense.
4) Caombining with #1, pitching is 44% of the game, fielding 6%.

Pete is usually sharper than that. My own feel is that fielding is in
the 25-33% of defense range; call it 30-70 between fielding and
pitching.


I'd give baserunning a little more credit than that, maybe 45-5, or
even 40-10. Give a team of Roberto Alomar and a team of John Oleruds
identical batting stats (which wouldn't be that unreasonable), and
even if you don't let Roberto steal a single base, they'll score a lot
more than the Oleruds by going first-to-third more often. (No offense,
Gordon).",sports

Preliminary negotiations started already, I believe.  Though the word
is that they are going slooooooooooooooooooooooowly.",sports
"
     Here is my traditional experience with tickets, playoffs and otherwise,
at the Civic Arena.

     Scalping is illegal but nonetheless present outside the Arena.  Best 
strategy, given that you don't mind missing the Anthem (which is OK if B.E.
Taylor decides to come back ever again :) ) is to wait until 7:40 or 7:45,
when the game is rolling; the scalpers are at this point desperate to sell
and will reduce to near or at face value to get rid of their tickets.

     Playoffs are a little different in that good seats will go early on; 
what's left at 7:45 may be nosebleed material (D, E sections).

Others can add on their opinions as well.",sports
"
Actually, this part was really interesting.  It turns out that the mask is
custom-fit to the goalie's face.  The goalie puts his/her face through a
piece of wood (or was it plastic?) with a hole in it that allows only the face
and forehead to show.  Hair is covered by a cap, eyes are covered by a plastic
wrap-type material, and vaseline is put on the goaltender's face.  Then, a
plaster is spread on their cheeks, forehead, and chin which takes about 12
minutes to dry sufficiently.  When it dries, it is effectively a mold of the
goalie's face.  This is used as the basis of the mask (the rest involves
padding the inside, hardening the exterior, fitting the cage, etc. etc.  
John Blue of the Bruins actually demonstrated the procedure on the show. 


Yeah, Essensa's mask looked really good.
 

Actually, I thought I heard him say that it _was_ Potvin's for certain.  I
would bet money on it either way...and it did look awesome!

Canada won 4-1 against Sweden! The last goal for Canada was at 19:59 in
the 3rd period. Maybe you shouldn't go and get you another beer

MY HOCKEY EDUCATION?  What the f--- are you talking about?  I'm
not even going to try to refute this absolutely insane statement. 
 
 
 
""I hate the Habs"" ?...you sound like a 10-year old.  This
statement is just further exemplifies your total inability to
argue objectively about hockey.  Don't give me this crap about
""cogent arguments""...I've yet to read something of yours that is
cogent.  You consistently argue with: (1) emotion; (2) huge,
sweeping statements
 
Frankly, you have a very unconvincing style.
 
I'm not defending Bob Gainey...frankly, I don't care for him all
that much.  But your dismissal of him as something less than an
effective hockey player is tiresome...it has no basis in
anything.  How many Calders did he win? I think it was four (go
ahead and refresh my memory).  What about the Conn Smythe?  Was
that a fluke?  Yeah, not the makings of a hockey superstar, I
know, but try to have a reason, any reason, to shoot him down.
 
 
 
 
Hey cowboy!  You're the ""expert"" who introduced the idiotic
comparison of Gainey with Gretzky and Lemieux...you figure it
out.
 
 
 
How many individual awards between them? Eight...I don't remember
(once again, please feel free to refresh my memory...and try to
be as sarcastic as possible about my ""hockey education"").
 
 
 
OH MY GOD!!!  Did I say that?  Roger...what's your point?  Fuhr
is a goaltender, goaltender's don't ""plug""...in his prime, he was
one of the best.  Sanderson was a scrapper...if you stick him on
you may as well include half the Flyers team of the same era.
 
 
 
Oh Roger, you shouldn't...really.  I don't deserve this...you are
far too accomodating already.
 
 
 
You seem to have allowed all of these other players fall into
your sweeping, vacuous statement...that's why.  If you want to
debate Gainey, go ahead...but why bring up everybody else?  How
does it support your argument?  Do you have an argument, or do
you just like to throw around a few names hoping to impress us?
 
 
 
Great.  I couldn't agree more.  The Flyers won two cups for the
same reasons...deservedly so.  So what?  I don't get it.  Are you
angry that the Leafs didn't get more recognition?  
 
You seem to think these pluggers are ""hyped""...I don't
agree...plain and simple.  If you're last statement is some sort
of compromise, fair enough.
 
 
 
Not a pleasant bone in your body, eh Rog?  Why are you so
unhappy?  Not getting invited to enough parties?  What?
 
 
Roger, why are you under the impression that responding to your
posts is some great honour?  You really should stop...it sounds
a little bit pathetic.  Frankly, it's about as honourable as a
good fart.
 
congenially, as always,

Devallano went earlier and more extensively to the Russian strategy
than anyone else...and was the first GM to ""waste"" high draft choices
on young Russians...Devallano would still be GM but he succombed to
Demers pleading to make the Oates-Federko et al trade...which is the
deal that sealed his fate.

Murray has made some decent trades...no doubt...but these are more
due to the stupidity or cheapness of other teams than brilliance on
his part...Washington was too cheap to pay Ciccarelli so they
essentially gave him away...and Carson was really a big anchor to
the team, and he was able to sucker a rookie GM to give him Paul
Coffey for deadweight.

If Detroit still fails this year because he was one defenseman short...
then he will have wasted an opportunity because Manson was available,
and he was unable to pull the trigger.  It is his judgement that he
has enough with what he's got...Yzerman doesn't have that many more

"I thought I'd post my predicted standings since I find those posted by others
to be interesting.  Sorry this is after Opening Day.  I certify that these
were completed before the first pitch. :-)

AL East
1.  New York Yankees - the most (only?) improved team in this division
2.  Toronto Blue Jays - Stewart and Morris?  No way.
3.  Milwaukee Brewers - they always seem to do better than I expect
4.  Baltimore Orioles - Pitching, but Devareaux, Anderson, and Hoiles will drop
5.  Cleveland Indians - Still don't seem to know what they are doing
6.  Detroit Tigers - All key players but Fryman are another year past peak
7.  Boston Red Sox - Any team with Clemens and Viola might be beter than 7th

Al West - this division was the toughest for me to pick.  Whoever of the top
          4 gets pitching should win it.
1.  Minnesota Twins - young pitchers seem to have best chance for success
2.  Texas Rangers - I don't know why I have them here.  Jose Canseco?
3.  Chicago White Sox - Frank Thomas but no pitching.
4.  Oakland A's - LaRussa is the best manager and would keep any team close
5.  Seattle Mariners - I like Pinella, but don't see much here
6.  Kansas City Royals - will score no runs
7.  California Angels - will win no games

NL East
1.  Montreal Expos - good all around, plus no Wallach!
2.  St. Louis Cardinals - (Jeffries + Whiten) >> (Jose + Clark), no Galarraga
3.  Pittsburgh Pirates - youngsters will take up more slack than expected
4.  New York Mets - some good players, still not a ""team""
5.  Philadelphia Phillies - they don't impress me
6.  Florida Marlins - they know what they're doing
7.  Chicago Cubs - they don't know what they're doing

NL West - The 2 best teams in baseball are in this division.
1.  Atlanta Braves - Awesome starters, but offense could be a concern
2.  Cincinnati Reds - Would not surprise me if they won it all
3.  Houston Astros - Any team that signs Uribe won't contend. Closer to 4 than 2
4.  San Diego Padres - Plantier could be the Sheffield of 1993
5.  Los Angeles Dodgers - better pitching than the Giants
6.  San Francisco Giants - because the Rockies just stink
7.  Colorado Rockies - will become the Seattle Mariners of the NL.


NLCS  Montreal d. Atlanta  (Braves fans, yes I'm probably contradicting
                            what I said in my NL West comment.)
ALCS  New York d. Minnesota

World Series  New York d. Montreal - Hating the Yankees will be
                                     fashionable again

NL MVP:  Barry Bonds, or maybe McGriff
NL Cy Young:  Jose Rijo
AL MVP:  Frank Thomas will deserve it (again), but Fielder might win it
AL Cy Young:  Roger Clemens (at least will deserve it (again))

Could be. There is a Jayson Stark that writes weekly for some press syndicate 
and also for Baseball America.


Stark has done this sort of thing, but he has never been serious about it.
He usually states that this sort of projection is useless at the top of 
such columns. I think he did it one season and some manager was ""projected"" 
to be thrown out of 60 games and some hitter could expect to be plunked 
150 times.

Stark does some really funny stuff. His weekly baseball reviews are good

"Well, I gotta tell ya,

last night's Leafs game vs the Devils was a nail-bitter LET ME TELL YOU!
It was a well played game by BOTH teams (I thought) but according to the
Don and Ron it was the an ""off-night"" for the Leafs and the Devils 
were outplaying Toronto. Well, I BEG to differ....

IMHO, Clark deserved to be a first star as much as Gilmour did. His
fast breaks towards the net and the good opportunites that he
created reminded me of the Clark of old. (But not to take any of the
credit away from Gilmour).

I think the Leafs are playing GREAT hockey. WHY? 
Well first look at their injury list which includes, Cullen, Ellet,
Zezel, Macoun. Of course my question is this....how will the Leafs
fare when they are once again ""healthy"" if they are playing this well
so far??

Second, just look at their standings, still second in defence,
moved from 11th overall to 6th over in the last month, haven't lost
at home in last 12 games, 8 game undefeated streak..etc.
(BTW, am I wrong or was this Potvin's first shut-out? I can't 
remember him having any as of yet.)

Well, as of April 3 we see that the race for first in the Norris
has truly begun and it will be a VERY CLOSE race between Chicago and
Toronto. And the best game of the season will probably be their last
against each other. (is anyone lucky enough to have tickets to
see this one?)

Can anybody name a player who was 'rushed' to the majors (let's, for
argument's sake, define ""rushed"" as brought up to the majors for more than
a cup of coffee prior at age 22 or younger, and performing below
expectations), whose career was damaged by this rushing?  I'm serious; I
tend to agree with David that bringing the player up sooner is better, but
I'd like to look at players for whom this theory didn't work, if there are
any.  I'd prefer players within the last 10 years or so, because then I can
look up their minor league stats.  (It's important to distinguish between
players who legitimately had careers below what their minor league numbers
would have projected, as opposed to players who were hyped and failed, but
actually had careers not out of line with their minor league numbers).  

Let's kick it off with an example of a player who was ""rushed"", although
there doesn't seem to have been any damage to his career.  Jay Bell was
given 135 PAs in the major leagues at age 21, and performed well below what
you would expect from his AAA numbers the same season.  He got 236 PAs the
next year at age 22, and still underperformed.  However, the next year, at
age 24, his performance improved, and he won the everyday shortstop job,
and has been there ever since.  It's really hard for me to see where he
would have been better off staying in the minor league (where he was
performed quite well in AAA) during this time, rather than being ""rushed"";
Cleveland might have been better off, I suppose, because they might have
been less likely to give up on him.

Yes, if you bring a player up early, he's likely going to struggle.  But
does that delay the time at which he stops struggling, and starts
performing up to expectations?",sports

little.

I know what you mean!  I glow everytime Ronnie's out on the ice.
In fact, one of the neatest things about seeing the Pens in person
is that I can key in on him instead of watching what I'd probably
be seeing on tv.  He does so many subtle things behind the play.

He said in an interview recently that when he was a kid his dad
stressed the importance of playing two-way hockey; that you have to
learn how to play defense as well as offense and he obviously took
that advice to heart.  He was a breath of fresh air when he arrived
in Pittsburgh to the team whose forwards, for the most part, couldn't
and wouldn't play a lick of defense.

It's really difficult to assess what the key trades were that brought
all of this success to the Pens.  You mention Rick Tocchet and he has
certainly helped, and even ol' Kjell has been steady.  But looking at
this team you could almost take any one of them out of the line-up
permanently and replace them with an extremely mediocre player and it
wouldn't matter.

If I had to pick the top three acquisitions in recent years they would
be 1) Tom Barrasso; 2) Ron Francis; 3) Larry Murphy.  (I'd love to put
Francis first but I do think the only thing that could really damage
the Pens right now would be to lose Barrasso.)",sports
"Disclaimer -- This is for fun.

In my computerized baseball game, I keep track of a category called
""stolen hits"", defined as a play made that ""an average fielder would not
make with average effort.""  Using the 1992 Defensive Averages posted
by Sherri Nichols (Thanks Sherri!), I've figured out some defensive stats
for the second basemen. Hits Stolen have been redefined as ""Plays Kurt
Stillwell would not have made.""

OK, I realize that's unfair.  Kurt's probably the victim of pitching staff,
fluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let's put it this way:  If we
replaced every second baseman in the NL with someone with Kurt's 57.6% out
making ability, how many extra hits would go by?

To try and correlate it to reality a little more, I've calculated Net
Hits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league
average fielder would make.  By the same method I've calculated Net Double
Plays, and Net Extra Bases (doubles and triples let by).

Finally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or
DCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.
I add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which
should represent the player's total contribution to the team.  So don't
take it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this
article.

The short version -- definition of terms
HS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell
NHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder
NDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder
NEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder
DCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate.
DOPS -- DCON + OPS -- quick & dirty measure of player's total contribution.

More discussion --

DCON formula:  ((NHS + NDP)/PA) + ((NHS + NDP + NEB)/AB)
Why such a bizzare formula?  Basically, it's designed to be added into the
OPS, with the idea that ""a run prevented is as important as a run scored"".
The extra outs are factored into OBP, while the extra bases removed are 
factored into SLG.  That's why I used PA and AB as the divisors.

Another word (offense) makes them my pick for last too.
(Well, there's also my policy of never picking a Buck Rodgers' team for last)


The 1961 Angels were  1/2 game out of 7th. The Athletics and 
expansion Senators finished tied for last. 
The 1962 Colt 45's finshed 8th - ahead of the Cubs (the Mets were last).
The 1969 Royals finshed 4th - ahead of the White Sox (the Pilots in last).
The 1977 Mariners finished 6th - ahead of the Athletics(in last).

Apparently being an expansion team with a poor A's or Chicago 
team around is a `good thing'


This may be an appropriate comparison.
The 1929-31 Yankees finshed 2nd, 3rd and 2nd finshing 
18, 16 and 13-1/2 games out of first. 
In 1933,'34 and '35 they also finished second ( though they were only
7, 7 and 3 games out).

Catcher is their weakest position, with the possible exception of second base.
They have a chance to simultaneously replace their biggest offensive problem
spot with a well-above-average offensive player *and* acclimate a highly
promising potential star with no pressure on him to carry the team, and they
want to play *Olson* and *Berryhill* instead?!


""A catcher's defensive reputation will be inversely proportional to his
 recent offensive level of performance.""  Thus, Mickey Tettleton goes (in
 the media) from being a no-hit defensive whiz to a slugging thumb-finger
 in two short years.  The rule doesn't apply to perceived ""superstars"", who
 get the Gold Glove Offensive Transfer effect instead.  Greg Olson is probably
 considered to be a good defensive catcher precisely because he can't hit.



Aren't they the same thing?


Either that or just stupidity.


Of course.


One could make the same sort of argument in other cases.  Pete Rose, in
pursuing Ty Cobb's record, was a huge gate attraction (and national media
magnet).  The Reds made a lot of money off that; they also wasted the prime
of Eric Davis.  That may be ""good business"", but that doesn't mean I don't

Let's be honest.  The Pens may not 'loose' one game as you

     But good ones can collapse somewhat, then come back the next year.
Burleigh Grimes went from 20+ wins and an ERA of 3 or so in '24 to 13-19 and
an ERA around 4 in '25.  He pitched well for several more years.  Carlton
won 13 and lost 20 the year after his 27-10 record. (Source: Bill James
Historical Baseball Abstract.)
     And let's not forget John Tudor, who started 1-5 and finished 21-6 in
1985.  He had a pretty bad ERA when you take Busch Stadium into account at
the start of the season.


     If I recall, he had a 4.50 ERA in the 1st half and a 3.50 ERA in the
2nd half of last year.  
     Hmmm, 21 runs in 11 innings.  Suppose he starts 30 more games, and winds
up w/200 innings pitched.  If he allows 4 runs a game in the next 189
innings, he'll have a 4.75 ERA or so at the end of the year. (I think I have
his totals right.) This is going to be hard to come back from.


     My 1st hunch is that Morris is very gutsy, and that he may be pitching
through an injury and not telling anyone.  My 2nd guess is that he will be
banished to the bullpen the remainder of the season after a few more starts.
(Perhaps when Stewart comes off the DL?  Or will Danny Cox, who went 3 or 4
scoreless innings against the Tribe today, start for Morris?  He looks like
a really good one.  Gaston is scrambling to find starters, I'd imagine.
Luckily, the Jays have a very good offense.)
     I don't think they would dare release him before the end of the year.
He'll just be replaced by Stewart or Cox.",sports

	NPR's Morning Edition aired a report this morning (4/19) on
	Hispanic/Latin American players in MLB and how they have many of
	the same problems faced by black/negro/African American players
	when they first entered the league.  However, although baseball
	has adjusted to the presence of black players, many Hispanic
	players still labor under the stereotype of being ""fireballs,
	hot blooded, flashy"".  The report also emphasised that despite
	the rantings (my word) of Jessie Jackson about baseballs
	discrimination against black players in its upper echelons,
	baseball has actually done much better by black players than
	Hispanic players.

	Another interesting point was the language barrier problem.  The
	reporter elaborated on an interview with Ruben Sierra which he
	gave in Spanish to a Spanish speaking newspaper reporter with
	the fact that there are maybe 2 major baseball writers that
	speak Spanish, despite the fact that Spanish is one of (if not

	McCarthy learned Spanish at age 50 in order to research his
	book, _All The Pretty Horses_.  Yet, few MLB organizations
	employ Spanish speaking personel, one of the exceptions being
	the Oakland A's.

	Another point:

	Nearly 90% of Latin American players have some African blood.
	Yet, most report that they'd never really felt black until
	playing ball in the US.

  
	Ironically enough, it is the early presence of Latin American

According to the Defensive Average stats posted by Sherri, Baerga had the
highest percentage of DPs turned in the league, while Alomar had the worst.
However, Alomar had a higher Defensive Average.  So who would be better?

Using Alomar's opportunities (469 groundballs, 73 possible double plays)
Alomar had 332 groundouts and turned 18 DPs.
Baerga would have had (with same DA & DP%) 328 groundouts and 35 DPs.

Using Baerga's opportunites (545 groundballs, 99 possible double plays).
Alomar would have had (with the same DA & DP%) 386 groundouts and 25 DPs.
Baerga had 381 groundouts and 47 DPs.

Baerga looks better, though it's possible his DP% would be lower with a 
different SS.

Will Baerga consistently turn twice as many double plays, however?  Alomar
has established a high level of defense, Baerga has not.  I would bet on
Alomar to be better next year, but last year Baerga was just as good overall.

We have no way of knowing because we cannot separate Morris' contribu-
tion  from the rest of the team's.  There is only one way of determin-
ing ""best"" in baseball.  And that is by looking at the  scoreboard  at
the  end  of  the game.  Each game determines which *team* is the best
that day.  At the end of the season, the team that was  the  best  the
most  often  is  the best in the division.  The playoffs determine the
best of the best.  But the point is that the only decision making pro-
cess  used to determine the ""best"" is the score of the game and it re-
lates to the *teams*.  Not the individual players.  There is no method
inherent  in  baseball of comparing individual performances.  And that
is how it should be, because, after all, baseball is a team game.

To say that one player is better than another is to be able to say ab-
solutely  that  player A's team would have played better with player B
in their lineup.  Sheer speculation.  Impossible to ascertain.

If you want to select a group of statistics and claim that Clemens has
done  better  with those statistics as a criteria, then fine.  But you
have  to  be  able  to  prove  that  those  statistics   measure   the
individual's  contribution  to  winning  the WS - because  that is the
only measure of ""best"" that has any meaning in the  context  of  base-
ball.   So  until you can prove that Clemens contributes to a WS cham-
pionship more than Morris your evaluation of  Clemens is totally  sub-
jective  and  is  mere opinion.  I have yet to see that any of you can
predict a WS winner with any greater accuracy than Jeanne Dixon.


Exactly.  The Jays won with Morris pitching.   And  Boston  wins  with
Clemens pitching.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens.
I am saying that individual comparisons between  players  are  totally
meaningless  and  that anyone claiming that Clemens is better based on
his ERA has missed the point of what baseball is all about.


You don't have to be rude.


For you to say that means that you have either missed the entire point
of  my  argument, or you yourself have committed a fallacy - Ignoratio
Elenchi.  I am not saying that Morris is better than Clemens   because
he   has  more   rings   (although  I  have,  tongue in cheek, claimed
that in the past).  I am saying that it is impossible to  isolate   an
individual's  performance   from that of his team's for the purpose of
comparing that individual's performance with another individual's per-
formance.

The stats are a nice hobby and  that's  about  it.  There  is  no  new
knowledge being produced.  So when a poster claims that Morris is better
than Clemens because he has more rings, the poster is no more nor less 
incorrect than the rest of you baying hounds.

"I've been following the Giants closely over the off-season -- newspapers,
notesgroup, etc -- but I had my first up close and personal last night at
the Stick.

After watching Giants hitters struggle last year, Barry's swing was 
very impressive -- he's very quick and his swing seems effortless, even
compared to Clark (particularly Clark as of late).

It was interesting to see Bonds hit Maddux so well.  I'm not sure if
Barry was after revenge against the Braves or what but he stroked
three very pretty hits (1b, 2b, hr) for 5 rbi's.

The Giants as a team are doing a lot of surprising things this year in
addition to Bonds.  There has been some good pitching and some hitters
seem to be swinging much better.  Clayton's defense has been superb.
McGee seems to like leading off this year.  Manwaring is driving the ball.
So on & so forth.

I hope it continues...I think they need to continue well into June before
people are really sold that they are for real--particularly the pitching.

For myself, I think the fresh start of Magowan/Baker/etc has really wiped
out a lot of negatives from the last few years and will be a real factor
in helping them significantly improve over last year.",sports

"The FLYERS blew a 3-0 lead over the Buffalo Sabres in the second period, but

comeback scoring his 75th and 76th goals of the season which tied the game at

Game Summary:

Say, if anybody from Buffalo is reading this, where did you people get that
woman who sang the anthems? We had to turn down the volume!

The FLYERS defense started out the game showing everybody why the FLYERS have
been shutting teams out lately by holding the Sabres to only 8 shots in the
first period. They then showed everybody why they will be playing golf Sunday
when they gave up 37 shots in the last two periods. Maybe Tommy told them that
he was getting bored back there...

Mark Recchi opened the scoring so fast that if you blinked you missed it. After
Buffalo won the faceoff and dumped, Tommy wrapped the puck around the boards
to Eric 1/2 way up on his left. Eric dropped it to Galley, and he sent it ahead
to Recchi steaming out of the zone. Mark skated into the center circle, passed
the puck to himself through the legs of Richard Smehlik, skated around him and
in on Fuhr. Smehlik was pulling at him all the way through the zone with his
stick, Recchi drifted right, drifted back left, and slid the puck back to the
right past Fuhr for a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 0:18. It was so beautiful Eric and
Garry should turn down their assists :-).

The FLYERS kept the pressure on Fuhr for a while after that, but he was strong
and kept the FLYERS from doing further damage. The game then became a defensive
struggle for a while. The Sabres got the first chance on the power play when
Terry Carkner took a boarding minor at 10:26 for crunching Dale Hawerchuk into
the boards in the FLYERS zone. LaFontaine got the only scoring chance, and not
a terribly good one, as the FLYERS smothered the Sabres power play. Mogilny got
a post after it was over. The 25th consecutive penalty kill for the FLYERS.

Keith Carney took a holding penalty at 13:31 for taking down Mark Recchi to
give the FLYERS a power play. The best penalty killing team in the league
didn't allow the FLYERS a shot on goal, although the FLYERS did create a
good scoring chance for Lindros who partially fanned on his shot. Towards
the end of the period the play started going end to end, but everybody kept
missing the net. Greg Hawgood took an interference penalty at 18:19 to give
the Sabres another power play, but they couldn't get anything going and the
fans expressed their displeasure, particularly when they iced the puck. Shots
were 8-6 Buffalo after the FLYERS had led 6-2 at one point.

Mike Emrick interviewed FLYERS president Jay Snider between periods. Jay was
disappointed to not make the playoffs, but not discouraged. This was considered
a rebuilding year after *The Trade* and he seemed very happy with the way the
season went. When asked if he agonized over *The Trade* he said that it was
Russ Farwell's trade and not his, that it only was an issue for him and Ed
Snider as far as the money. But yes, there was some agonizing, and they'd do
it all over again. When asked how the coaching situation would be handled for
next year he said that it's Russ' call, and Russ will evaluate things at the
end of the season. He feels that they're 3 years away from a shot at the Cup.
He expects to get into the playoffs next year, have a shot at a division title
the following year, and a shot at the finals the year after that. This based
on the current level of play and anticipated improvements over the summer.

He's very happy with the re-alignment (he called it ""outstanding""). Happy with
the current expansion, feels that the talent pool is big enough with the unflux
of Europeans, but feels that they must make sure existing franchises are stable.
Seemed to like the idea of playing in the Olympics (booo) but said that there
was a definite split among owners and that this certainly would only happen in
four years if there was a consensus.

The Sabres gave the FLYERS their second power play of the game when Brad May
took a tripping penalty at 0:51 of the second. The FLYERS had a little trouble
getting started, but eventually did. Hawgood took a pass as he was moving
throug the neutral zone and handed the puck to Eklund just outside the Sabres
blue line along the right boards. Eklund carried into the zone nad passed
across to Dineen who tried a one timer from between the blue line and the
top of the left circle. He half fanned on it, and sent the puck trickling
through the slot. Fuhr didn't know where it was, though, and Hawgood won the
race to it and flipped it into essentially an open net at 2:15.

Then Mogilny on a breakaway. He slipped through two FLYERS at the blue line
and went in on Soderstrom. He went with the backhander, but Soderstrom was
all over it.

The FLYERS then took some bad discipline type penalties that really hurt them.
Viacheslav Butsayev took a double minor for roughing and high sticking when
Barnaby got under his skin and drew one minor, then according to Gary Dornhoefer
took a dive to get the other (there was no video) at 4:22. The Sabres coudln't
get started. Ryan McGill poked at the puck just after a Sabre carried into the
FLYERS zone, and after a bunch of people poked at it Dineen emerged with it and
headed the other way. It started out a 1 on 1, but Brind'Amour hustled ahead to
make it a 2 on 1 and back off the defenseman. Dineen let it rip from the top
of the right circle to make it 3-0 FLYERS at 5:40. That was all for Fuhr, John
Muckler sent in Dominik Hasek to take over.

But the Sabres still had lots of power play time. Again they took some time to
just get into the FLYERS zone, and when they finally did the FLYERS were all
over them. Boos began to ring through the building. But they finally got through
Soderstrom on an ugly goal. Smehlik took a shot from the top of the zone that
missed and kicked out to Hawerchuk in the slot. Hawerchuk tried a backhander as
he skated towards the goal line to the right as Galley dove down to block it.
Mistake #1, he should have let Soderstrom handle the backhander and worried
about A) the rebound or B) Barnaby who was camped behind the goal line right
next to the net. Well, the rebound dropped right next to Soderstrom, and
mistake #2, Galley just laid there and watched Barnaby get THREE hacks at the
puck before he finally pushed it through the goalie. He didn't even swing his
stick out to try and knock the puck away. With the goal, at 7:48, two streaks
end for the FLYERS. 150:28 of shutout hockey, and 27 straight penalty kills.

Lindros put them right back on the power play at 8:36 with a high sticking
minor, I think it was Barnaby again. This time the Sabres were able to get
set up quickly, but couldn't get too much quality on goal. The Sabres continued
to keep the puck in the FLYERS end for a while after the power play ended.
Things evetually settled down, but then the other very bad penalty. McGill
allowed Barnaby to get under his skin and slashed his stick just before a
faceoff. The gloves were dropped, and McGill started pounding the crap out of
him. But during the fight, he gave Barnaby a head butt with his helmet, and
that meant a match penalty. 2 for slashing, 5 fighting and 5 for the major,
7 minutes of power play time for the Sabres at 14:15, Barnaby only got 5.

The FLYERS were keeping them at bay for a while, but there was only so long
they could do that. After a couple of good Sabre chances, Audette handed to
Ledyard at the point, and Ledyard sent a drive that was knocked down by
Soderstrom. LaFontaine whacked at the bouncing puck from the left side of
the net, and knocked it over to Randy Wood at the right. Soderstrom had
moved over to play LaFontaine, and since Yushkevich and Carkner were waving
at the puck instead of picking up men, Wood just slid it into the empty net
at 17:34 to close the FLYERS lead to 3-2. LaFontaine was actually trying to
put it on net, but half fanned on it and got a break.

The FLYERS then got some shorthanded pressure in the Sabres zone, but Hasek
was strong. Finally it was Keith Carney passing ahead to Hawerchuk into the
neutral zone, and Hawerchuk sent a good backhand pass to Mogilny at the FLYERS
blue line. Another mini-breakaway for Mogilny, he elected to shoot from the
left circle, and he threaded the needle to get it just inside the far post at
18:56 for his 75th of the season. Ironically, the youth hockey tip between
the 1st and second period was Tommy Soderstrom talking about cutting off
angles...

That was all in the 2nd, shots were 19-7 Sabres.

Into the 3rd period, and Pelle EKlund blew a golden opportunity to get the
FLYERS the lead back. A 2 on 1, Acton with the puck, he dropped to Eklund in
the slot, and Eklund held the puck as he slid through the left circle until
he had almost no angle at all to shoot from. When he finally did shoot, he
hit the far post. That was still during the carryover power play time.

Than an incredible almost goal. Randy Wood skated around Recchi and Hawgood
untouched into Soderstrom. Soderstrom goes down, Wood pokes the puck under
Soderstrom, and a black object hits the back of the net. Red light comes on,
horn sounds, crowd cheers. But up to the video replay booth, for some strange
reason, and in the meantime Emrick and Dornhoefer try to figure out what they
could be reviewing. Well, it turns out that it was the taped up stick blade
that went into the net, not the puck. Emrick mentions that one of the criteria
for scoring a goal is that the puck must go into the net...

Dave Hannan then took out Recchi and got a holding minor at 2:35. The FLYERS
could not get anything going at all. They finally got set up 1/2 way through,
but were kept on the perimeter. As time ran out, Beranek stripped the puck
from a Sabre in the offensive zone along the right boards and passed it across
to Eklund at the top of the left circle. Eklund saw Dineen heading at the net
just inside the right circle and passed through to him. Dineen fumbled the pass,
but twice directed it at Hasek, and Eklund swooped in and chipped the bouncing
puck over the goalie for his 11th at 4:42. 4-3 FLYERS.

But the Sabres came right back. LaFontaine picked up the puck in his offensive
left corner and slid it to Bob Erry behind the FLYERS net. Erry started to skate
out, but then just dropped the puck back to nobody behind the net. Mogilny flew
in, skated around, and stuffed it through Soderstrom's 5 hole for his 76th at
5:24 to tie the game at 4.

Then Hawerchuk took a retaliatory roughing penalty at 5:55. The FLYERS set up
in the Sabres zone, and stayed there. Off a faceoff high in the Sabres zone in
the middle. While Brind'Amour wrestled for the puck, Dineen snuck through the
line and wristed a perfect shot low to Hasek's glove side at 6:44.

Play started to go back and forth until Hawgood took a roughing penalty at 8:19.
The FLYERS dumped the puck into the Sabres zone. Brind'Amour and Ledyard went
after it, and Rod got the puck. He backed away from the right boards, skated
to the right faceoff dot, and passed between his legs to Dineen crashing
through the slot all by himself. Dineen waited patiently and lifted it over
the blocker of Hasek for a 6-4 FLYERS lead at 8:39. 3rd hat trick of the season
for Dineen, 7th of his career, 2nd shorthanded goal of the game for him 35th
of the season.

Then Carney took a tripping penalty at 9:02 to kill the rest of the Sabres
power play. Not much action on the 4 on 4, and the Sabres got most of the
chances on the FLYERS resulting power play.

Play went end to end for quite a while after that and both goalies had to
make some big saves. The Sabres weren't able to pull Hasek as time was running 
out as the FLYERS wouldn't allow any consistant possession for the Sabres.
Finally as time was running out Ken Sutton misplayed the puck in his own left
corner and Brind'Amour stripped it away from him. He pulled away and found
Dineen on the other side of the left circle, and Dineen found Acton at the
right of Hasek. He slid the puck between two Sabres defenders, and Acton
chipped it back to the far side of Hasek for his 8th of the season at 19:48
on his 35th birthday. That was all the scoring, shots were 18-13 Buffalo,
and the ice was showered with plastic drinking mugs handed out before the
game.

So another strong game from Tommy Soderstrom who hadn't been tested much
in his last couple of starts. Kevin Dineen has a career high 6 point night
(unless he had a better night earlier in the season, but I don't think so).
The FLYERS longest winning streak in 3 years, 30 goals for only 11 against
with three shutouts. Eric Lindros is 8th in league with 33 even strength goals
despite missing 23 games with injury. 4 points out of 4th, clinched 5th place
since the Rangers lose the tie breaker.

A couple misc notes:

Forget the Mike Keenan rumors, there will be a press conference tommorrow to
announce that he will be head coach of the New York Rangers next year.

In the last notes I mentioned that Garry Galley won the Barry Ashbee Award,
but I failed to mention that the award is for the best defenseman.

The Times of Trenton has reported that ""a preeminent specialist from Oklahoma""
has looked over Tommy Soderstrom's medical record and determined that no
further tests are necessary in the near future.

Same paper had a blurb about Bill Dineen being asked about whether or not he
expected to be back next year. His response was that he wants to come back,
he feels he did a good job this year, but that he would cheerfully accept a
role scouting if Farwell didn't want him back.

your logic is curious, and spurious.

there is no reason to believe that Viola wouldn't have won as many games
had *he* signed with Toronto. when you compare their stupid W-L records,
be sure to compare their team's offensive averages too.


now, looking at anything like the Morris-Viola sweepstakes a year later
is basically hindsight. but there were plenty of reasons why it
should have been apparent that Viola was the better pitcher, based
on previous recent years and also based on age (Frank is almost 5
years younger! how many knew that?). people got caught up in the '91
World Series, and then on Morris' 21 wins last year. wins are the stupidest,
most misleading statistic in baseball, far worse than RBI or R. that he
won 21 just means that the Jays got him a lot of runs.

the only really valid retort to Valentine is: weren't the Red Sox trying
to get Morris too? oh, sure, they *said* Viola was their first choice
afterwards, but what should we have expected they would say?

Biggest surprise = the player who rose above expectation -- the player
      that may have raised the level of his game to a new height, even
      if that new level doesn't necessarily warrant an allstar berth
      (includes those players who at the outset of the season, may not

Paul Stewart is the worst and most biased ref. presently in the NHL.
He called a total of 4 penalties on the Habs and one on the Nordiques.
The Nords' penalty came in O.T.  Stewart, being an ex-Nordique himself,
was looking to call penalties on the Habs while letting the Nords
get away with murder...WE WAS ROBBED!!!!

It was an excellent game with plenty of end-to-end rushes and tremendous
goalkeeping.  The Nords tied it with over 1 minute to go while Lebeau
was serving a penalty.  I don't mind Stewart calling a penalty in the
last 5 min. of the game, but AT LEAST BE FAIR ABOUT IT.  The Nords were
caught with their hand in the cookie jar more than once.  Stewart turned
the other cheek...BASTARD!

Patrick Roy collapsed after letting in the tieing goal. He was shaky and
on his knees for the rest of the night.  The winning goal shouldn't have

plenty of chances to capitalize, Muller, LeClair, Haller, etc. but
failed to put the puck in the net.  That's what did them in.  But
Mr. Stewart didn't help matters at all.

Oh well, at least the Bruins lost in O.T. also Ha, Ha!!--)

Actually, fired-coach George Kingston was a third of the GM
triumvirate.  Now that the trio is now duo (Dean Lombardi and Chuck
Grillo), the Sharks are already on their 3rd ""office of the GM"". And a
4th is likely to happen before September; they'll either add the new
coach to the OofGM, or name a single GM. So your wager should be
amended to read that Sharks are likely to have their 5th GM before the
Panther's get their 2nd. Can't wait to see how the next season's NHL
Guide and Record Book lists the GM history of the Sharks.

Given the depth of next year's draft, the expansion draft rules, and
the reputation of their GMs, Anaheim and Miami look pretty good as the
first 90s expansion teams to win a Cup.  San Jose and Ottawa have
instability at the GM position, something that Philly, NYI, Edmonton,
and Calgary did not have when they won their first Cups. Pittsburgh
did, but they needed a quarter century.",sports

 Canada     10 13  6 - 29     6*2min

 Bill Ranford stopped 36 shots to lead Canada to a 4-1 victory in a very well
 played game.

 The first period started with a give away from a Canadian defenseman and
 Rundqvist came in alone on Ranford but couldn't put the puck over a sliding
 Ranford. Later on, Kevin Dineen had a great opportunity but Soderstrom 
 played very well too. Stefan Nilsson had a couple of great dekes and set up
 Jan Larsson but again Ranford came up big. Period ended scoreless but the edge
 to Sweden in creating more opportunities.
 Second period action saw Tommy Soderstrom making a GREAT save. Mark Recchi
 made a backhanded cross ice pass to Lindros, Eric one timed the puck but
 Soderstrom was there to make a glove hand save. At the 7-minute mark, Canada
 started applying pressure on the Swedes. Sanderson-Dineen-Brind'Amour worked
 hard and kept the puck in the Swedes' zone. Dineen gave the puck to Sanderson
 who skated around a screened Swedish defenseman, came in on Soderstrom and
 made a wrist shot that went it by Soderstrom's far post, 1-0 Canada.
 The Swedes picked up their game after that, and Peter Forsberg had a shot
 that hit Ranford's post (the inside), went parallel to the goal line and out.
 Then Gartner got a penalty and the Swedes a power play. Jan Larsson took
 a shot from the slot, Ranford gave a rebound to Larsson who saw Juhlin by
 the far post, passed the puck and Ranford was beat, 1-1.
 Third period started as the other periods, Swedes having most of the pressure
 but the Canadians always dangerous once they were close to the Swede goal.
 At 5:54, Canada created some great chances and Arto Blomsten was forced to
 cover the puck in the Swede goal crease since Soderstrom lost sight of it.
 That resulted in a penalty shot, since a defenseman can't cover the puck in 
 the goal crease. Geoff Sanderson took the penalty shot (his first ever, he
 explained afterwards), and he put it low on Soderstrom's stick side, close
 to the post. Excellent penalty shot to give Canada a go ahead goal.
 Canada increased the lead on a very suspect offside, Gartner volleyed a
 bouncing puck past Soderstrom to make it 3-1. The Swedes ran out of gas
 then and couldn't produce as good scoring chances as they had for 2,5 periods.
 The 4-1 goal came with only 1 second left, Rod Brind'Amour scoring on a
 rebound from Soderstrom, where the Swedish defense already had their minds
 in the dressing room.

 A very good game (the best in the WC so far?), with both goalies playing
 great. Soderstrom best player in Sweden, but Ranford even played better
 than Soderstrom, that tells you something about Ranford. Probably the best
 goalie in the world, were some comments after the game.
 Canada played a very disciplined defense, Ranford pointed out that it is
 easy to play well with a good defense. Lindros played A LOT and played well,
 Sanderson naturally game hero with two goals.

 The Forsberg-Naslund-Bergqvist line Sweden's best along with Larsson-Juhlin-
 Nilsson. Swedish defense played well, 197 cm 104 kg Peter Popovic had the
 task of neutralizing 192 cm 107 kg Eric Lindros, and managed this very well.
 Ranger defenseman Peter Andersson finally got to go to the WC, and considering
 that he landed in Germany just a few hours before the game, he played very
 well. Swedish coach Curt Lundmark was irritated after the game, partly because
 of the Swedes inability to score, and partly because of the linesman's mistake
 on the 1-3 goal.

 I hope some Finns can provide information from this game (I didn't see the
 whole game). The Finns took the lead on a Jarkko Varvio slap shot from the
 blue line, and a soft goal for an unscreened Mike Richter.
 As far as the play in the second period goes, the Finns seemed to have the
 most control, so a 1-0 lead was warranted as I saw it.

Yes, a point well-taken ... however, even in areas that finally got
some games, there's something nagging in the back of your skull when
the network that has the national rights in its pocket says on its
sports news, ""There's an awesome overtime going on in Quebec City,
and we'll *try* to get you an update through the show ..."" when you
know that it's on a satellite's feedhorn somewhere up there ...


From today's Times, ABC got great ratings in Chicago and St. Louis (a
4.2), and the Kings-Flames got a 2.9 on the West Coast, but only a 2.2
in metro New York (i.e., the Devils squandered their newfound support
from a year ago when they played the Rangers )-;).  In comparison,
Seniors Golf did better ...


I fear that the overall national numbers will not be so great ...
I can't tell if ABC did any advance marketing or not, 'cos I don't
watch much TV ... the NHL should have made sure that it was solid
on cable before going on the air.  Even ESPN could've sold second
rights to third party systems (i.e., non-SportsChannel) since they
are not making any extra money by sitting on the games ... hockey
fans will not necessarily be watching pre-season beach volleyball

Greg,

    The story goes like this:

       Spanky is too slow!  If he were quicker, he would still be here.
But with Slaught and Tom Prince, they didn't want to lose Prince in order
to bring up that 11th pitcher.  Slaught is about as good as Spanky and
Prince is coming along nicely!

      Don't feel too bad for him.  He's still gonna get theat $4,000,000
over the next two years -- he'll be able to do most of what he wants to
do.

"DALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTON
After announcing that they would pull their affiliation out
of Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind. 

The Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing
their minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they
wanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.

Enter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining
6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawks
in the New Brunswick city.

The deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if
the season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold
1400 for this year.

"#21	PETER AHOLA		Season: 2nd
Acquired:	'92-93, trade with Pittsburgh for future considerations
Grade:		I (B)

It is way too early to tell about Ahola, who was acquired probably because the
Penguins figured that they would lose him in the expansion draft.  Ahola had
only played 50 games this season (I think it's actually less; the San Jose
Mercury News may be in err here), 20 of them with the Sharks.  In the games he
has played, he appeared quite solid defensively, although he hasn't been
spectacular, and his offense isn't anything to write home about (8 points);
it's even possible that the trade may be for future considerations which turn
out to be ... Peter Ahola.

#24	DOUG WILSON		Season: 16th
Acquired:	'91-92, trade with Chicago for RW Kerry Toporowski and
		2nd round pick in '92 entry draft
Grade:		I (B)

I have often been accused of overly down on Wilson; I may have had too high
expectations for him, but his legs, knees, et al., are giving out.
Nevertheless, when he was playing, he exhibited a strong shooting and
playmaking abilities, even if he has lost a step on defense, which,
unfortunately, he demonstrated this year as well, as at times he was slow to
catch the opponent forwards, and his offensive output was only good enough for
2nd place on the team (20 points in 42 games).  But next year, which may be
Wilson's last, if he can stay healthy, he can still be a contributor.

#29	DEAN KOLSTAD		Season:	2nd
Acquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		I (C-/D+)

It's probably somewhat unfair for me to judge Kolstad on just a handful of
games (forgetting exact number, but no more than 15), but at age 25 he's
quickly running out of time if he wants to make it to the NHL.  In those games,
he did not impress anyone; after generating 7 shots in the first period of
the first game he played, he scored just 2 points in his tenure up here with
the Sharks, and was even less impressive defensively, as he appeared awkward
with his movement and was prone to giveaways.  He needs to make a leap in
his level of performance to have any chance of making the team.

#38	PAT MACLEOD		Season: 2nd
Acquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		I (?)

MacLeod was on the roster a lot longer than Kolstad, but it appears to my
memory that he played less than Kolstad, because the Sharks were reluctant to
use him, but were even more reluctant to send him to the minors, figuring that
he wouldn't clear waivers; in fact, he has played the past 4-5 weeks with
Kansas City, but is still technically there on a rehabilitation assignment,
a ""rehab assignment"" that will include him playing in the Turner Cup playoffs.
Since he has played so little, I can't even give a tentative grade on him, but
he demonstrated last year excellent offensive skills but terrible defensive
skills.

#41	TOM PEDERSON		Season: 1st
Acquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		I (B+)

Called up in the middle of the season when the defensive corps was decimated
by injuries, Pederson impressed many Sharks fan here on net, including yours
truly.  He demonstrated very good offensive skills, scoring 20 points in
43 games.  However, his size (5' 9"", 165 lbs.) is of concern, and soon after
he began to shine offensive did teams begin to push him around physically,
on both sides of the ice, although he had appeared fearless in his approach.
But to be successful, he probably needs to bulk up to have a fighting chance
on surviving against some of the bigger players in the league.

#45	CLAUDIO SCREMIN		Season: 1st
Acquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		I (D+/D)

He played all of ~5 games in the league this year, but was thoroughly
umimpressive, just as he was at the end of last season; again, it may be a
small sample, but just as in the case of Kolstad, Scremin, at age 25, is
quickly running out of time.  He was not a contributor on either offense or
defense in the games he played with the Sharks.  The only notable thing that
will go down in Scremin's entry of league stats is probably the fact that he
was once traded for now Capitals goaltender Don Beaupre.",sports
"There's a lot of whining about how much players are overpaid.  I thought
I'd put together an underpaid team that could win a pennant.  I splurged
and let four of the players earn as much as half a million dollars; the
highest-paid player is Frank Thomas, at $900K.  I cut some players, like
Kenny Lofton, Chris Hoiles, Keith Mitchell, Tim Wakefield, and a bunch
of pitchers, all of whom could have arguably made the team better at a
cost of $1 million for the lot of them.  The total team salary is 
$7,781,500, averaging slightly over $300K a player.  If that's too steep,
you can dump Thomas and Bagwell, replacing them with Paul Sorrento and
a minimum wager to save a bit over a million dollars, and still have one
of the best teams in the majors.

" It's the ""opening-game effect"" maybe. Pros arrive late, nervousness for
 rookie WC players, and problems to get the lines clicking may make things
 hard to get it going against these ""worse"" nations.
 I'd guess that the better team you face in the opening game, the better
 it is, since the chances of an upset are greater then.

 Some other reasons why the ""worse"" teams are so tough to beat was presented
 by Hans ""Virus"" Lindberg (former coach in Switzerland).

 1) The ""worse"" teams (referring to France, Switzerland, Austria, Italy etc)
    have now usually world class goalies.

 2) Their defensive play have become much more disciplined, they take much
    less unnecessary penalties.

 3) They use four lines which makes it harder to make them ""run out of gas.""

 4) The ice quality in the German WC rinks is poor.

"Buck Showalter just can't win. 

Bob Wickman's pitching the game of his life through eight innings (Yanks
lead 6-1), so Buck decides to let the kid try and get his first complete
game. Wickman manages to get two outs, but in between, four funs score,
and all of a sudden it's 6-5, and Wickman just can't get the third out.
So Buck goes to the bullpen, and Farr gets out the first guy he faces.

Last night, Jimmy Key is pitching another in a long string of games of his
life (this guy just keeps getting better!) through eight innings (Yanks
lead 4-0). This time, Buck thinks, ""I don't want a repeat of that
near-fiasco with Wickman, so I'll give my bullpen some work."" Steve Howe,
whose ERA was 54.00 coming into the game, left with it at 81.00. He didn't
do too good. Then Farr comes in. He gives up a two-run homer, and the
Royals win it, 6-5.

What's going on? This is already the third or fourth time this year that
the bullpen has blown a lead. Farr & Howe have done it twice together,
Monteleone's done it once, and I think even Habyan did it once. What's the

 Markus had a good season in MoDo in the Swedish elite league, scoring
 22 goals, 17 assists, 39 points and 67 PIM in 39 games.

 As Daryl points out, Markus won't be joining the Pens for this year's

 But there is a good chance that Markus will join the Pens before next
 season. MoDo, though, naturally wants to keep their superstars Forsberg

 personal sponsors for Forsberg and Naslund in order to match the kind
 of money they would receive in NHL.


 Actually, Swedish coach Curt Lundmark is thinking about leaving two
 spots open for additions from eliminated NHLers. It is Mats Sundin and
 Calle Johansson that Curt hopes can join the team, although in a late

You all know how things turned out.  The Orioles, Red Sox, and Yankees
all disappeared.  The Jays and Tigers continued at essentially the
expected pace.  The Brewers and Indians cranked in the second half.

The Rangers predictably took a dive.  That shouldn't have surprised
anybody.  Meanwhile, as predicted, the Mariners dropped behind the
Angels and Royals.  They clearly didn't deserve the 22-33 record in
June.  The White Sox and A's upped their game a bit, while the Twins
dropped off a little.  But for the most part things were as expected.

Okay, so there were a few blatant errors.  But for a predictive
calculation, I thought this did pretty well.

if an injury happens), I may as well inject a little more
fuel to the flame!

1)  Back at the beginning of Spring Training, I though
Lopez would make the squad easily.  Olson was still
recovering from his late-season injury (knee, I believe),
and there were questions as to whether he would be
able to play before June.  And then Berryhill was dinged up.

I was looking forward to this, because I believe that Lopez
can hit AND field the position.  Before last season, he was
the Braves ""Defensive Catcher"" prospect, while Brian Deak was
the Braves ""Offensive Catcher"" prospect.  Besides, Olson
and Berryhill couldn't hit their way out of a wet cardboard
box, and don't walk enough to be useful.

But Olson recovered quickly, Berryhill recovered, and the Braves went
with the two vets.  I still say that if one of those two had been down
at the start of the season, he wouldn't have gotten his job back.

2)  There is a certain logic to keeping Olson and Berryhill around.
After all, ML catchers are in short supply and suffer from wear and
tear.  There are teams out there without ONE average ML catcher
(California and Seattle come to mind).  Certainly, trying to
move Olson or Berryhill through waivers would be unlikely to work.
Plus, you'd have to eat that salary, which isn't huge, but isn't
tiddleywinks either (I think Olson's at about $800,000, Berryhill
at $450,000, but that's only what I recall).

3)  Yes, I think arbitration-eligibility may have a role to
play in this also.  What is it, that 5/6 of the 2+year players
aren't eligible for arbitration?   Only the 1/6 that were on the roster
the longest are eligible?  Of course, the system may change,
but the extent of that change is not yet known.  From a business
standpoint, it may make sense to keep Lopez down until June/the
first time Olson/Berryhill go on the DL.

4)  I am still disappointed that Lopez isn't on the team.
I still prefer to think of myself as a fan when it comes to the Braves,
and the truth is that I'd rather see our best team on the field,
which, IMO, includes Lopez.

Of course,today we play the Cubs.  Hopefully, we won't need him. ;)

As for the Schuerholz/Cox conversation, I imagine it went
like this:  (Remember, they've BOTH been GM's)
(the following is not meant to be read by the humor-impaired)

Cox:  OK, we've sent Jones down.  His fielding could be a
little smoother.  Besides, Blauser can hit OK and his fielding
is better than it used to be.

Schuerholz:  Well, we'll have to send Nieves down too.  Deion
just won't sign that baseball only contract.  We can't count
on him in October, so we have to keep Nixon around for the
defense.  Besides, Gorman's not ready to give up on
Billy Hatcher yet.  Once Hatcher's gone AND Deion signs,
we can move Nixon for Frankie Rodriguez.  That ought to
give us some pitching depth in 1995.

Cox:  Yep, that'll be nice.  Too bad Deion won't sign.
OK, I'll look for Nieves when Justice starts having
Berry-Berry...er, back problems again.  Now, what about
Klesko?

Schuerholz:  Well, we've still got to fork out another 1.5 mil
for Bream.  If we keep Klesko, we either lose the money
or Cabrera.  I keep dangling Sid in front of Dal Maxwell,
but somehow he doesn't seem to be the same GM.  First
Jeffries for Jose, and now Whiten for Clark!  If he
gets rid of Brian Jordan, then I'd HAVE to believe that he
and Whitey Herzog switched bodies at the Winter Meetings!

Cox:  OK, keep trying on Bream, and I'll wait til the trading
deadline for my Hunter/Klesko platoon.  Maybe I can get a few
extra at-bats for Cabrera while we wait.  Try California...
if Snow starts slowly, maybe WhiteyDal will bite on Sid.
And if that doesn't work, then perhaps Sid's knees
could be ""persuaded"" to act up.  There's always the
15-day DL!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha-ha!

Schuerholz:  What about Caraballo?

Cox:  Well, he's not that much better than Lemke.  Maybe if he starts
in Richmond, he'll start walking more.  Besides, if he's going to be
arbitration-eligible, better to stretch him out so that we actually
get some value from him before he makes the big bucks.

Schuerholz:  Now, let's see.  That leaves Lopez.

Cox:  NOOOOO!  I gotta keep Lopez!  Sure, I didn't think Olson
would recover this quickly.  Maybe I can talk Caminiti into
running into him again?

Schuerholz:  Nope, Lopez has gotta go.  You know that he'll get
$3 million in arbitration.  May as well put it off that one
extra year.  Besides, until Olson's shown his stuff a little
bit, I can't trade him.  Besides, Berryhill's a left-handed
hitter.  You know how rare that is?

Cox:  Don't you mean a left-handed whiffer?  Pretty common,
if you ask me.  I mean, he made Pat Borders look good in
the World Series.  PAT BORDERS!!!

Schuerholz:  Hey, you're the one who wouldn't write Lopez
into the lineup.

Cox:  Well, you're the one who went out and got me Jeff
Reardon!  Besides, I thought Lopez wouldn't be used
to our pitching staff's stuff.  He got some time with
them this spring...looked pretty good.  Come on, surely
we only need to keep one stiff behind the plate?

Schuerholz:  Yeah, but which stiff?  Whichever one we keep
will be hurt by May.

Cox:  OK, OK, you made your point.  Keep them both.  Surely
one of them will be on the DL by June at the latest.  Then I
can call up Lopez, and then we can win 110 games!  The Pennant!
THE WORLD SERIES!  I'll be up there with John McGraw!  Casey
Stengel!  Earl Weaver!  Oh, they laughed at me in Toronto,
but have you ever had to deal with George Bell?  I'll finally
get my just reward!  Mwa-ha-ha-ha!

Schuerholz:  Easy, Bobby.  Have you been taking those
""happy pills"" left around by Chuck Tanner?  Why'd you
ever hire that guy anyhow?

Cox:  Don't ask me; ask Ted.

"Farewell, Minnesota fans.  Get stuffed, Dallas Stars.

As the North Stars fade to black, I hope that Minneapolis/St. Paul are
not long without an NHL team.  It just seems ""right"" that the hotbed of
amateur hockey in the USA should have an NHL team as well.  The loss of
the team is certainly not the fault of the fans (though the start of the
1989-90 season made it look real bad for a while).

I wish now that I kept the North Stars cap I bought at Maple Leaf
Gardens the morning after they eliminated Montreal in 1980.  (I got it
to spite the Montreal fans in the small town where I grew up.)  What a
glorious season that was for the North Stars!

out hitting.

take Kariya.  He should alot of leadership in the NCAA and so far in

was released, because, in the event of an injury to Slaught,
LaValliere is no longer capable (they believe) of being the everyday

I'm not sure I understand this question. When the IF rule is invoked,
the batter is automatically out. This relieves the runners from being
forced to advance to the next base if the ball is not caught. Other
than that, isn't it just the same as any situation in which a runner on
a base is not forced to the next base on a dropped fly ball? That is,
if the ball is caught he can tag up and run (or decide to stay), and
if the ball is dropped he can have left the base at any time.

For your information, Lankford is injured (I think it is his shoulder or rib
cage), so he could not use him as a pinch hitter.
 
I do believe that Whiten was a very good aquisition for the Cards.  He does
not have too much offensive capabilities, but he is an awesome defensively.
Since when have the Cardnials actually thought of offense instead of defense?:)
I forgot who St. Louis gave up for him, but it was not too much.
 
As far as Gilkey is concerned, he is a leftfielder and so is Brian Jordan, who
beat him out.  I expect to see a Gilkey/Jordan platoon in LF.
 
I agree with you on this one.  As soon as Larkin threw that ball, I knew that
Lankford was a dead bird.  But how could Dent have known that Larkin would make
a perfect throw?
 
I strongly believe that Torre is one of the best managers in baseball.  Don't
forget the overachieving Cards of '91 that won all those close games and went
from last place to second place (although they were oveshadowed by the Braves/
Twins last to first climb).  He won a division title, and barely lost a pennant
race when he was with the Braves (why Atlanta ever even considered firing him I
will never understand).  With Torre at the controls, the Cardinals are heading
in the right direction.
 
One more thing, one game does not make a season.  Yes, they lost to the Reds,
but with the second best pitching staff in the National League (first in the
East), and a pretty good offense, the Redbirds will win a lot more than they
lose.  Maybe this is the year that they will go all the way.

In what still, IMHO, ranks as the all-time greatest PR blunder (not to
mention on-ice blunder) the Whalers ever committed, GM Eddie Johnston and
Coach Rick Ley 'decided' that Francis was incapable as a leader and stripped
him of the Captain's ""C"" in December of 1990. The whole organization (read:
EJ and Ley, and by default owner Richard Gordon because he was too much of
a dupe to know how much he was being blind-sided by EJ) dumped on Francis all
season, starting with refusing to sign him to a new contract, publicly 
humiliating him, stripping him of the ""C"", and then trading him that Spring
to the Penguins. Classy guy, that EJ.

The loss of Francis (and too a lesser extent, Ulf), was one of a series of
decimating player moves by EJ which stripped the personality and fan-awareness
from the team that has put them in the precarious position they are in today.

[Gratuitous good EJ note...he did preside over the organization when it
acquired Verbeek, Cassels, Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, etc. He stripped the
roster but he DID lay a foundation.]",sports

Well, maybe it will be.  Banks is a 24 year-old prospect who ""hasn't 
matured as quickly as they would have liked.  Mahomes is a 22 year-old 
who is very highly touted.  Tapani and Erickson are also young, and 
have looked very good this spring.  The last spot was between Jim 
Deshaies, formerly of Houston and S.D. and Mike Trombley.  Deshaies 
hasn't looked very good this spring, so I believe that the spot has 
gone to Trombley, although they hadn't wanted 3 starters this unproven. 
I personally believe very highly in Mahomes and Trombley.


Well, Scott Leius is the shortstop.  He played mostly 3B last year, but 
was a SS in the minors, and moved back after Gagne left to K.C.  3B is 
split (maybe) between Pagliarulo, who has had a great spring, and Terry 
Jorgenson, a good looking kid who has languished in Portland for 3 
years.  I'm not sure how the time will be divided, but they seem to be 
happy with what they have here.  I like Jorgenson, but I fear they 
might give too much time to Pags.

For anyone who didn't see Sunday's game,

With a right hander pitching he decides to bench Lankform, a left handed
hitter and play jordan and gilkey, both right handers.

Later, in the ninth inning with the bases loaded and two outs he puts
lankford, a 300 hitter with power in as a pinch runner and uses Luis
Alicea, a 250 hitter with no power as a pinch hitter.  What the Hell
is he thinking.

Earlier in the game in an interview about acquiring Mark Whiten he commented
how fortunate the Cardinals were to get Whiten and that Whiten would be a
regular even though this meant that Gilkey would be hurt, But torre said
he liked Gilkey coming off the bench.  Gilkey hit over 300 last year,
what does he have to do to start, The guy would be starting on most every
team in the league.

Furthermore, in Sundays game when lankford was thrown out at the plate, 
The replay showed Bucky Dent the third base coach looking down the line
and waving lankford home,

I'm still catching up from Spring Break, but bear with me...



Javy Lopez has proven, over 1400+ AB in the minor leagues, that he is
ready to play in the majors. He is *not* being rushed. Players who are
clearly too good for AA and play behind stiffs at the major league level
are wasting their time, and may actually have a court case against
major league management for keeping them, at AAA.


Unless Lopez is *me* defensively (I'm 5'7'', 165 and born to play
second base :-)), he belongs in the major leagues.


Valentine isn't saying he should back up. He's saying he should be put
in a position to *win* the job in the major leagues, which, IMHO, he
would if given the opportunity. (Val, if I'm misinterpreting, please
let me know.)



But the players who *are* ready are 1)the best and 2) the ones most
likely to benefit from being in the majors. Javy Lopez is not a middle-
of-the-road prospect. He's the real thing. NOW. 

Again, the most important thing a player can do is hit. Lopez does that
miles better than Olson or Berryhill. If his defense is good enough for
Greenville, or Richmond, it's good enough for Atlanta. If he really was
awful defensively, he would no longer be a catcher. See Sprague, Ed.


Oh, where to start... OK. First of all, solid != good. I want good players.
Solid is one of those words used to describe nice white guys who really
aren't very good at baseball. Think of it as ""TWG"" without the caps.
It's a losing strategy to say, ""We have solid guys, we don't need to improve.""
You used it four times in that paragraph, BTW.

Same for experienced. I might add, though, that Greg Olson and Damon
Berryhill aren't exactly Carter and Fisk. Olson has played three years,
Berryhill five, although 90 and 91 were a wash. The only difference,
IMHO, between Olson and Valle is the supporting cast.

""Two big bats."" Hrm. I like Justice, but I find Mr. Gant's trend disturbing.
Call it one and a maybe. The Braves' platoon is OK, but neither player
has *any* value outside of the platoon. Bream vs. LH and Hunter vs. RH
are awful. I'll leave the thirdbase comment alone. Pendleton has wasted
too much bandwidth already. If the CF platoon hits .300, I'll retrace
Mr. Likhani's midnight run down Forbes, and I live in NY and LA.
(Got that, Mike?)

And doesn't Cox call pitches, anyway?


Nope. They're baseball management, possible the most short-sighted 
collection of people in the nation. Do you not believe this goes on,
Mark? Do you think Frank Thomas needed those three months in AAA in
1990? Or Cal Eldred wasn't *really* better than Ricky Bones last year?

  While Atlanta has the undisputed best starting rotation, I feel that their
relief staff may be suspect.  They don't have a real closer -- although
Mike Stanton (4 saves) has been used in that role.  Didn't Stanton start off
great last year and then falter?  Despite this, your point is well taken.
Atlanta doesn't seem to have the same personality as a NY team, thus is 
unlikely to self-destruct.  For Houston to take 'em, Atlanta needs to
suffer some injuries, particularly to their starting rotation.



  From what I understand, Boever and Murphy were considered expendable by the
club.  Houston felt that their positions could be filled by a number of
players..  Art  Doug Jones is the key to Houston's success.  He must have
another great year for Houston to challenge in the NL West. 

lousey spring.


      Right!  A strong rotation will take the pressure off of the troubling
      bullpen.



      The unsuspected strength of the lower part of the order has saved the
      club so far.  Biggio and Finley just aren't doing their job of getting
      on base.  Instead of filling his role as an RBI man, Bagwell has had to
      assume Biggio and Finley's job.  Biggio concerns me, since he usually
      starts the season very strong.

     On a side note, are you at all concerned with the rumors concerning
next year's uniform?  There is talk that their road uniform will be
(blech..) traditional grey, with the word ""HOUSTON"" written across the
chest.  If I'm not mistaken, their home uniforms may totally eliminate
the color orange (shiver..).  McLane's favorite color is red, so...
     I'm really upset.. the current unforms are dull and the new ones sound
horrible.  I'd like to see the uniform of the mid-1980s return.  They
may not have been pretty, but Houston had established a long precident of
wearing the ugliest uniforms in baseball -- and I liked it.

"For the second straight game, California scored a ton of late runs to crush
the Brewhas. It was six runs in the 8th for a 12-5 win Monday and five in
the 8th and six in the 9th for a 12-2 win yesterday. Jamie Navarro pitched
seven strong innings, but Orosco, Austin, Manzanillo and Lloyd all took part
in the mockery of a bullpen yesterday. How's this for numbers? Maldanado has
pitched three scoreless innings and Navarro's ERA is 0.75. The next lowest
on the staff is Wegman at 5.14. Ouch!

It doesn't look much better for the hitters. Hamilton is batting .481, while
Thon is hitting .458 and has seven RBI. The next highest is three. The next
best hitter is Jaha at .267 and then Vaughn, who has the team's only HR, at
.238. Another ouch. Looking at the stats, it's not hard to see why the team
is 2-5. In fact, 2-5 doesn't sound bad when you're averaging three runs/game
and giving up 6.6/game. 

Still, it's early and things will undoubtedly get better. The offense should
come around, but the bullpen is a major worry. Fetters, Plesac and Austin gave
the Brewers great middle relief last year. Lloyd, Maldanado, Manzanillo, 
Fetters, Austin and Orosco will have to pick up the pace for the team to be
successful. Milwaukee won a number of games last year when middle relief either
held small leads or kept small deficits in place. The starters will be okay,
the defense will be alright and the hitting will come around, but the bullpen
is a big question mark.

In other news, Nilsson and Doran were reactivated yesterday, while William
Suero was sent down and Tim McIntosh was picked up by Montreal. Today's game
with California was cancelled.",sports

Well, since the Oilers didn't win a heck of a lot of games, I'm not sure
they deserve and MVP (""can't win without him"").  However, I'd suggest Kelly
Buchberger instead of Dave Manson, who has had a brutal year, his pick for
the All-Star game notwithstanding.

As for biggest surprise, I'd say that Buchberger had higher expectations
this year due to his ""breakthrough"" year (for him) last year, so he didn't
really raise his game.  My suggestion would be Shjon Podein, one of the
callups from Cape Breton during the year.  He was quite far down on the
depth chart in the Oilers stable of prospects, but made a big impact on
the team.  He has 12 goals in his 33 games and is only -1.  Those are decent
numbers for a third-line player who was seemingly doomed to minor-league
oblivion.  The Oilers coaching staff likens his style to John Tonelli.
I think he'll be on the full-time roster next year.

As for biggest disappointment, you could name any of the players the Oilers
dumped for lousy production this year (Nicholls, Gilchrist, Tikkanen) or
even Shayne Corson, but Mellanby isn't far off.

"I can't believe that the NY Rangers would force its 
players to go to Binghamtom to play in the AHL playoffs instead
of letting them represent their countries in the World Championships.

Anderrson and Zubov are waiting for the NHL to make a decision to this,
while Kovalev has given in and gone down to the minors.

The Rangers are a disgrace.

the hiring of Mike Keenan. How long will Smith be in NY for?",sports

	It's not really crap you know... only half crap ;-)   From what i 
understand it's very expensive to play hockey south of the border... 
(actually it's not that cheap up hear either... though once you have all the
equipement it's not more than $300 a year... actually i haven' played in
about 8 years so i could be off a bit... )  In the states, where ice time
is considerably more expensive it can cost over a thousand a year... compare 
this to baseball and you'll see that hockey is a sport for the well-to-do...
And this brings up the fact that the well-to-do in the US are majority white...

BTW: what was the original question... i think it has to do with the Hispanic
communtiy and playing hockey....

we were (for some reason) trying to come up with names of Jewish

with much, except for Sandy Koufax, (somebody) Stankowitz, and
maybe John Lowenstein.  Can anyone come up with any more.  I know

Despite walks and loses, Ryan deserves to be in the Hall of Fame (IMHO)
based only on his ho-hitters.  The strike-out records are an extra.

"Went to the Dodgers game tonight -- it was cap night.
 
Astacio pitched ok, but had control trouble all night.
In the first, he walked a batter, balked him to second, then
a single scored the run, with the batter taking second on the
throw home.  Another single made the score 2-0 Cards.
 
Lasorda tried a new line up featuring Butler, Reed, And Piazza
batting third!  Darryl and Eric were benched in favor of Snyder
and Webster.
 
Piazza homered in the first to make the score 2-1 Cards.
The Dodgers tied the game in the second on a two out single
by Offerman.
 
By the fourth inning, Astacio had already made about 80 pitches, but
the score was still 2-2.  The Dodger defense made SEVERAL impressive
plays.  Piazza looked GREAT behind the plate, gunning down a runner
trying to steal second, throwing a runner out at first who
had strayed a bit from first base, etc.
 
Karros also made a spectacular play, keeping a ball from going into
the outfield.  The runner on first was so sure that ball was going
through, he just kept running past second.  Karros got up and threw
to third and EASILY got the runner at third.
 
My heart sank in the 7th when Gross got up to warm up in the bullpen.
 
Astacio was lifted for a pinch hitter, and when Gross entered the game
with the score still 2-2, Dodger fans just KNEW it was over.
 
Gross was relieving because he stunk on Tuesday, pitching just 2 1/3
innings, forcing Lasorda to use much of his bullpen.  The 15 inning
game had the same effect the next night...so only Gross was fresh
given his light work out Tuesday.
 
Gross lived up to his name.  He walked the first batter, gave up a hit
to the second, and walked the bases loaded.  After a grounder resulted
in a force at home, Zeile lifted a scoring fly ball to make it
3-2 Cards.  Gross paid little attention to the runners, and the next
thing you knew, the Cards had stolen a fourth run.  The runner on
first was eventually tagged out in the run down, but the 4th run had
scored long before that.
 
Meanwhile, the Dodgers mounted little offense after the second inning.
Lee Smith pitched the ninth.  He had little trouble getting Karros
and Wallach (does anyone have trouble with Wallach these days?).
Cory Snyder collected his first hit as a Dodger, a single, but
that was all the offense the Dodgers could mount.  Smith got his
third straight save against the Dodgers and all I got was my
free Dodger cap and a good look at Piazza.  If Piazza keeps this
up all year, he will be a strong candidate for rookie of the year
honors.  Though its really early, Karros is already showing signs
of a sophomore jinx year.
 
The final score...Cardinals 4 runs on 7 hits.
Dodgers 2 runs on 7 hits.",sports

No argument at all with Murphy.  He scared the hell out of me when he came in
last year.  On the other hand, the club though enough of Boever to put him into
an awful lot of games (he may have led the league in appearances - he did at
least at some point).  He seemed to be a very viable setup guy - but I guess
that's not considered that crucial by the club.  I can just remember two years
ago so well, though...
...

I'm not that concerned.  Those guys have been relatively consistent over the
years and they have no good reasons to decline (no injuries, not old, ...).
I expect them to come through just fine.  It's those guys that have not
been consistently good that are the worrisome part, even if they are coming
through right now.

This sounds like their old road unis.  Pretty dull.  Buttons or pullovers?
I'll check through my uniform book to see if they've always had some orange.


Well, we'll see.  I've got a Astros pullover shirt with the ""Astros stripes""
across the shoulders and I have trouble making myself wear it in public.  i
can see why they might want that to change.  Gee, if they eliminate the
orange, will they reupholster the seats in the Astros stripes section (what
used to be the gold and yellow levels - I don't know those numbers they use
now).

I saw a pinstripe version of an Astros cap and I actually thought it looked 
good!",sports
,sports
"You think that's bad?  I'm in Bowling Green, OH, and we get ABC from
Toledo.  Well, the cable co. decided to totally pre-empt the game (no tape
delay, no nothing) for a stupid telethon!  Hockey is very big around here,
too.  I had to listen to ""my"" Penguins win on my car radio out in the
parking lot.  I can just be thankful for a strong radio because being 230
miles from Pittsburgh, the reception usually isn't good at all.  I can't
believe I picked it up during the middle of the day.",sports
": I think most of the problems mainly arose from Manager Gene Mauch's
: ineptitude in managing the pitching staff.  Down the stretch, he
: abused Jim Bunning, Chris Short, and Robin Roberts (I think those
: are the three) pitching each on only 2 days rest for quite some
: time.  By the time they hit the last 2 weeks of the season,
: obviously none of these guys had an ounce left in their arm.  Oh
: well.

Roberts was long gone -- he was probably an Oriole in 1964.  Or maybe a
Colt .45.  The 3rd starter was Art Mahaffey, the previous year's ace.
Dennis Bennett was the 4th starter.

They were indeed 6.5 up with 12 to go, but they won their final two
games after the horrid 10-loss streak.  The final game victory
(Bunning's 19th win, if memory serves) kept the Reds from tying for the
title; they and the Phils were both 1 game behind the Cards, with the
Giants(?) another game back.  The Mets couldn't hold an early lead
against the Cards that final Sunday, or there would have been a 3-way
tie.  Too bad they couldn't have saved some of the 15 or so runs they
scored on Saturday when they crushed St. Louis.

- Notable team news (transactions and announcements)
 
 Note that this information is culled from press releases and posts.  It 
is updated each month and only information currently under discussion or 
of continuing importance or interest will be listed for more than two 
postings.
 
 Boston Bruins
  Boston legislators and the developers proposing a new Boston Garden 
finally agreed to a deal that puts the 19,000-seat, $160 million project 
back on track to be finished in September 1995.
  Right wing Daniel Marois will be sidelined indefinitely following 
surgery to repair a herniated disc in his back.
**
  Sent defenseman Glen Murray to Providence of the American Hockey League.

 Buffalo Sabres
1-800-333-PUCK (1-800-333-7825)
  Acquired left winger Bob Errey from Pittsburgh for defenseman Mike 
Ramsey.
**
  Veteran Buffalo Sabres broadcaster Ted Darling will be inducted into the 
club's Hall of Fame Sunday, April 11.  Darling, who joined the expansion 
Sabres in 1970, was the team's play-by-play announcer on both television 
and radio until illness forced him out of the booth during last season.
**
  Recalled forwards Viktor Gordiouk and Doug MacDonald from Rochester of 
American Hockey League.

 Calgary Flames
  Acquired veteran right wing Greg Paslawski from Philadelphia for future 
considerations.
**
  Recalled center Todd Harkins and left winger Tomas Forslund from Salt 
Lake City of International Hockey League.

 Chicago Blackhawks
        The $175 million, privately financed United Center, scheduled to 
open in August 1994, will be home to the NBA's Chicago Bulls and NHL's 
Chicago Blackhawks. The stadium is owned by entities controlled by the two 
teams. The owners apparently still have not made a decision on whether the 
old Chicago Stadium will be razed for parking space once the new facility, 
located directly across the street, opens.
  Suspended defenseman Craig Muni indefinitely for failing to report 
following a trade with Edmonton.

 Detroit Red Wings
  Acquired defenseman Steve Konroyd from Hartford for a sixth-round draft 
pick.
  Annnounced the signing of right wing Joe Frederick, their 13th pick in 
the 1989 National Hockey League entry draft.
**
  Two contrite hockey fans have returned the stolen Michigan Sports Hall 
of Fame plaque honoring Detroit Red Wing great Gordie Howe. The bronze 
plaque was stolen more than four years ago from Cobo Hall in Detroit, site 
of the Michigan Hall of Fame.

 Edmonton Oilers
  Sent forward Esa Tikkanen to the New York Rangers for center Doug 
Weight.
  Traded defenseman Craig Muni to Chicago for forward Mike Hudson.
  NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said the Edmonton Oilers' lease with 
Northlands Coliseum must be improved if the team is to survive in the 
city. Edmonton Northlands is a non-profit agency set up by the city to 
administer exhibition facilities including the Coliseum.  Oilers owner 
Peter Pocklington calls his lease with Northlands horrendous and has 
threatened to move the team if he doesn't get a better deal. He makes no 
money from parking, concessions or building advertising. The 17,313-seat 
Coliseum also has few of the lucrative private boxes that produce 
significant revenues for other owners.
  Announced center Kevin Todd will not need surgery but will miss the 
remainder of the season with a separated shoulder.

 Hartford Whalers
  Sent defenseman Steve Konroyd to Detroit for a sixth-round draft pick.
  Acquired left winger Robert Kron and a third-round draft pick from 
Vancouver for left winger Murray Craven and a fifth-round draft pick.
**
  The state of Connecticut will begin negotiations to buy the Civic Center 
from the city in an effort to keep the financially struggling Hartford 
Whalers franchise in the city.

 Los Angeles Kings
  Sent center John McIntyre to the New York Rangers for defenseman Mark 
Hardy and Ottawa's fifth-round 1993 draft pick.

 Minnesota North Stars
1-800-800-0435 if calling from the U.S.
1-800-800-0458 if calling from Canada

  Manon Rheaume's first starting appearance in goal for the Atlanta 
Knights was impressive enough for her coach to say she has a chance to be 
a backup goalie for another minor league team next season. Rheaume, the 
first female to play professional hockey, stopped 25 shots and gave up six 
goals against the Cincinnati Cyclones on Saturday night, April 10. After 
the game, her coach, Gene Ubriaco, said Rheaume performed well enough to 
compete for the No. 2 goalie spot with the Louisville IceHawks of the East 
Coast Hockey League next season. The Knights and the IceHawks are minor 
league clubs of the Tampa Bay Lightning.
**
  As their first season comes to a close, there are rumors swirling that 
the Tampa Bay Lightning just might become the Atlanta Lightning.  Or the 
Minnesota Lightning.  But they are just rumors, according to Lightning 
general manager Phil Esposito.  ESPN reported on Sunday, April 11, that 
the Lightning, who have been playing in 10,400-seat Expo Hall, are 
exploring opportunities to move to either Atlanta or Minneapolis.  But 
Esposito said there was no truth to the report.  ""We were disappointed 
with ESPN's irresponsible comment,"" Esposito said.  ""There is just no 
substance to the rumor."" Rumors have been swirling for the past two years 
regarding a move by Tampa Bay, which is presently discussing plans to 
build a new arena.

- Draft news:

        Under terms of the new expansion draft, which will be held in 
June, each of the 24 existing clubs will be allowed to protect one 
goaltender, five defensemen and nine forwards. The most recent expansion 
drafts allowed teams to protect two goalies and did not make a distinction 
between forwards and defensemen.
        First-year pros only will be exempt from the draft, which is down 
from the two-year exemption teams had last season. San Jose, Tampa Bay and 
Ottawa still will be allowed to exempt second-year pros.
        Each of the 24 teams will lose two players, with a maximum loss of 
one goaltender and a maximum loss of one defenseman. The one exception is 
that a team which loses a goaltender can then no longer lose a defenseman.
        At the end of the first phase of the draft, the two new franchises 
will have three goaltenders, eight defensemen and 13 forwards for a total 
of 24 players. A second phase then will be conducted where San Jose, Tampa 
Bay and Ottawa will select two players each from the rosters of the two 
new teams.
        Ottawa, Tampa Bay and San Jose will be guaranteed priority 
drafting selection in the 1993 draft as long as they have the three worst 
records. Anaheim and Miami will choose no lower than fourth and fifth. The 
expansion franchises will move up in the draft should either San Jose, 
Tampa Bay or Ottawa not finish in the bottom three positions.
        The two new teams will pick first and second in the 1994 Entry 
Draft, regardless of their finish in 1993-94. Should either of the two new 
teams not play next season they would have priority drafting position in 
1994.

        The owners announced the 1994 draft will be in Hartford and the 
1995 draft in Winnipeg. The 1994 draft was scheduled for Boston, but a 
delay in the construction of a new arena required the draft be moved.

        The site for the 75th Memorial Cup Tournament has yet to be 
chosen.  It will be staged in Ontario but the exact location won't be 
determined until next spring.
        In March of '93, the two regular-season division champions from 
the Ontario Hockey League will meet in a best-of-seven series at the start 
of the playoff season.  The winner of the series earns the right to host 
the Memorial Cup, traditionally held in May.
        The eventual OHL champion will also participate in the tourney. 
But if the league champs also happen to be the club hosting the Memorial 
Cup, then the league finalists will advance as well.""

  Six non-affiliated teams play a 60 game schedule extending from early 
November to mid March. Each team is owned by the league, with local 
interests controlling day to day operations. Each team has a $100,000 
salary cap for 17 total players (16 dress up). Unlike the ECHL, players 
are not limited to three years in the league.
  A Western Division may be added to the Central Hockey League for the 93-
94 season if the plans of CHL president Ray Miron materialize.  Miron 
confirmed that El Paso, Amarillo, Tuscon, and Albuquerque are cities under 
consideration for the Western Division, which would play some interlocking 
games with the Eastern Division.  Meanwhile, San Antonio and Houston are 
close to being confirmed as the league's newest members.

 - Major League Hockey
 
        A new hockey league with franchises throughout the United States 
and Canada will begin play in the fallof 1993, officials announced 
Wednesday, February 10.
        Major League Hockey was founded by Roy Boe, former president of 
the New York Islanders of the National Hockey League and the New York/New 
Jersey Nets of the American and National Basketball associations.
        According to Boe, the league will debut with six to eight teams 
playing a schedule of approximately 80 games. Franchise applications have 
been received from groups in Chicago, Cleveland, Dallas, Denver, Detroit, 
Houston, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Phoenix, San Francisco, Saskatoon, Toronto 
and Worcester, Mass., Boe said.
        Although the league will not raid existing leagues to stock its 
rosters, Boe said it will seek the ``world's finest hockey players.''
        Boe said league play will have an international flair and 
discussed implementing some rules which are reminiscent of those of the 
IIHF.
        ``We're removing the red line, moving the goal nets forward and 
eliminating all tie games,'' said Boe.
        The MLH office will operate out of Stamford, Conn.

 8. Answers to some frequently asked questions:
 
 Q: Why are the Montreal Canadiens called the Habs?
 A: Most of the team during the 40-50's was made up of people who lived in 
and around Montreal. Hence they were called ""Les Habitants"" (natives of 
Montreal). This was then shortened to the Habs.
 
 Q: Why is the Montreal Canadiens logo a large C with an H within it?
 A: In 1914-15, the Canadiens logo consisted of C with an A within it to 
signify Club Athletique Canadien (CAC). The next year, CAC no longer 
existed and it was changed to what it is now to signify Club de Hockey.

 Q: What is the most informative hockey publication?
 A: The Hockey News is preferred by most North American hockey fans. It is 
a weekly journal with up-to-date info.
Phone: 800-268-7793 (Canada and US)
Phone/fax: 0483 776141 (UK and rest of Europe)
 
 Q: How does a 5-minute power-play count in the penalty killing stats in 
the NHL?
 A: If X goals are scored, then the team gets credit for X goals in X+1 
chances.
 
 Q: How is +/- computed in the NHL?
 A: First, +/- only applies to skaters. Except for a power-play goal, when 
a goal is scored, each skater on the ice for the scoring team is given a 
+, and each skater on the ice for the other team is given a -. Short-
handed goals do count for +/-.
 
 Q: What is the five-hole?
 A: The space between a goalie's pads. There are five major scoring zones: 
(1) upper left corner of goal, (2) upper right, (3) lower left, (4) lower 
right, and (5) five-hole.
 
 Q: What is the meaning of throwing an octopus on the ice?
 A: This tradition began in Detroit in the 1950's when two best-of-seven 
series were required to win the Stanley Cup. Every time Detroit won a 
game, an octopus with one less arm was thrown on the ice.

 Q: Who was the first woman to play in an NHL game?
 A: Manon Rheaume, a 20-year-old goaltender, became the first woman ever 
to play in an NHL game on September 23, 1992 when she started in net for 
the expansion Tampa Bay Lightning in an exhibition against the St. Louis 
Blues. Rheaume played the first period before 8,223 at the 10,400-seat 
Expo Hall on the Florida State Fairgrounds and allowed two goals on nine 
shots. She left with the score tied 2-2, although the Lightning ultimately 
lost the game, 6-4.

 Q: What is the richest contract in NHL history?
 A: Mario Lemieux, the superstar center of the Pittsburgh Penguins, signed 
the richest contract in NHL history, a seven-year deal believed to be 
worth about $42 million. Lemieux will earn between $6 million and $7 
million a year, nearly twice as much as any other player in the league.

 Q: Who is the new commissioner of the NHL?
 A: Gary Bettman, vice president and general counsel of the National 
Basketball Association, was named commissioner of the National Hockey 
League, Friday, December 11, 1992. Bettman joined the NBA in 1981 as 
assistant general counsel. He became the league's chief legal officer in 
September of 1984. A New York resident, Bettman graduated from Cornell 
University in 1974 and from New York University School of Law in 1977.

 Q: How many professional hockey leagues are there in North America?
 A: Six:  National, American, International, East Coast, Central and 
Colonial Hockey Leagues.

Um, the header said *career.*  Hodapp managed about 3000 PA in his
nine years in the majors.

As for his ""consistently over .300,"" make that ""three years in a row, 
preceded by a part-time year, plus his last year, with Boston.""  Hodapp
only qualified for the batting title five times.  

Was he injured?  He retired right around his 28th birthday.

Anyway, Hodapp put up flashy numbers the year *everybody* put up
flashy numbers.  That was his only really good year with a bat; 
his other .300 years were marred by a lack of power and an inability
to draw walks.  Only 163 of those 3000 PA were bases on balls, which
does not describe a feared hitter.

with identical records, as well.  Poor Devils -- they always get screwed.
Yet, they should put a scare into Pittsburgh.  They always do!  Pens in 7.",sports
"

	This is the crux of the argument (to me at least).  Both the
SDCN and the non-SDCN camps seem to agree on the fact that a catcher's
defense is basically nonmeasurable at present.  You can talk about how
important calling a game is, or framing the pitches, or blocking balls
in the dirt.  But there is little or no way to tell exactly how various
catcher's rank in ""defense"".  

	Looking at Lopez specifically; is there any reason to suspect
that he is a bad defensive catcher other then the fact that the Braves
(or the media) has labeled him a bad defensive catcher?  As far as I
can tell he doesn't have any particular problem in his mechanics
(such as Sasser).  He might be a little rough around the edges in blocking
the ball, or framing the pitch to get a good call but all he needs to
clear that up is playing and practice time.  I can't see how repetitions
at AAA are any better then reps in the majors!  

	All we're left with is the calling the game aspect.  Olsen  and
Berryhill at always given credit for calling good games and helping
the pitchering staff.  But this is a reputation that is given to almost
all veteran catchers.  How is catching at AAA going to help Lopez learn
the major league pitching staff?  The only way any catcher is going to
learn Tom Glavine's pitches is to catch Tom Glavine.  Similarly, I wouldn't
be supprised if the pitcher's claimed to prefer pitching to Olsen over
pitching to Lopez because they are used to pitching to Olsen.  But 
given time they will say they are comfortable with Lopez.

	Now, since Lopez can't learn how to handle the major league
pitcher's while he's in AAA and since he doesn't have any glaring
problem in his mechanics, what is he going to learn in AAA that he
can't learn just as well while in the majors?  ",sports

Right.  So who cares which PLAYER gets credited, as long as the TEAM
gets more runs?  If a player helps the TEAM get more R and RBI, but 
doesn't score them all himself, who cares?

Consider:

Player A: single.
Player B: grounder to short; reaches on the force at 2nd.
Player C: Double, B to 3rd.
Player D: Sac fly.

B gets a run, D gets an RBI.  Are you *sure* they helped the team
more than A and C?  Think hard, now.

Maybe because baseball is the only business where those who are
responsible for the fiscal aspects of the game preach gloom and doom. 
These allegedly intelligent people seem to predict bad times, losing
money, bankruptcies at an alarming rate, and there's going to be an
increased degradation of the product they produce.  Could you imagine
IBM, with all their problems, promoting themselves the way Major League
Baseball does?  Their stock would plummet to unthinkable depths (not
that they are too far from it now :-).  What would happen at GM?  Where
would GM be if they admitted to cutting corners and producing an
inferior product because of alleged labor problems? I think it shows a
lack of confidence for the people who run the game.

Jeez!  Look at Pam Postema.  Just because she's a woman, everybody on the
face of the earth thinks it's great that she's getting an opportunity to
ump.  If you even watched the games and had an IQ greater than that of
roast beef, you'd see that she is not nearly as good as most AAA umpires.
Besides, she is probably more worried about cracking a fingernail with a
foul tip off of Wade Boggs' bat. Or Jose Oquendo's bat. Either way, there
are too many complications.

And you wrote an *excellent* report about it.




I understand (from an unreliable source) that Canseco was considered
expendable by the A's when he refused to accept any coaching about
his batting stance.  The A's brain trust came to believe that his
back problems were exacerbated, if not caused, by having a wide open
stance, closing it quickly and then swinging with a lot of torque
(that's a paraphrase of what I remember).

In any event, Canseco took the road that he and he alone would decide
his stance, and the A's began to believe that he would either reinjure
himself or begin to lose his ability to hit for both average and power.




Apparently, you sound like LaRussa.


The A's also objected about this.



Again, I'm just repeating something I heard.  But possibly the cause
and effect is the reverse of that.

"I can only comment on the Kings, but the most obvious candidate for pleasant
surprise is Alex Zhitnik. He came highly touted as a defensive defenseman, but
he's clearly much more than that. Great skater and hard shot (though wish he
were more accurate). In fact, he pretty much allowed the Kings to trade away
that huge defensive liability Paul Coffey. Kelly Hrudey is only the biggest
disappointment if you thought he was any good to begin with. But, at best, he's
only a mediocre goaltender. A better choice would be Tomas Sandstrom, though
not through any fault of his own, but because some thugs in Toronto decided 
to threaten his career in order to avoid conceding a goal. Other than that, the
award goes to Robert Lang, an uninspiring Czech. Robitaille could easily be
MVP, but I'd prefer to give it to Rob Blake who is quietly becoming one of the
league's premier defensemen, and if the Kings manage to hold onto him and the 
rest of our young defense, it could one day mean that we'll let in fewer
goals than Hartford. Honorable mentions to Majestic Marty and Warren Rychel.

First of all, has anyone on the planet heard of the team from Detroit?  Al
Morgani (or however you spell the idiot's name) must be from Chicago,
because on ESPN, he said ""it's not even close--Chicago will definatly win
the Norris Division in the Playoffs, no other team is close.""  Everyone is
picking Chicago!  I don't get it, he says it's an ""easy choice""?
God, Chicago was 1-4-1 against the Wings, and they won the division by a
point or two, followed closely by Toronto, who is also a good team!
As for the Leafs beating Detroit--doubt it, but even if they do, they
aren't going to get by Chicago.  If (even more amazingly) they get past the
Hawks, they would probably face Vancouver, and lose.
As for The Habs reaching the Finals, forget it.  Even I, as a devoted Wings
fan, will watch the Penguins easily three-peat as Cup winners.  Lemieux,
Jagr, Tocchet, Stevens, and Barrasso, its a done deal.  Sorry Detroit, wait

But hey, these were Paul's picks, and everyone has a right to their own

think that too many people are fearful that McLane will meddle in the team
as he has already admitted that he doesn't know a whole lot about baseball.
McLane is a businessman, and doesn't like excuses.  He makes a valid point
that injuries shouldn't be an excuse to this club.  Look at the depth of the
bench this season.. Canadele can play 7 positions; Bass and James are solid
outfielders and can hit well too; Uribe is nice to have as well..  The
pitching staff has 6 legitimate starters.  We're dealing with a young
Houston team, so injuries shouldn't play a big role.  The only threat is
the bullpen -- if Jonesy goes out, we may be in trouble but with the
type of starters we have this season, there is less pressure on the pen.",sports
"Hell, the Orioles' Opening Day game could easily be the largest in history
if we had a stadium with 80,000 seats. But unfortunely the Yards (a
definitely excellent ballpark) only holds like 45,000 with 275 SRO spots.
Ticket sales for the entire year is moving fast. Bleacher seats are almost
gone for every game this year. It's a extremely likelyhood that the O's
could sell out every game this year (especially if we lead the division for
most of the year like '89). 
	On another front, the sale of the Orioles to anyone is likely to be
forced upon Eli Jacobs who is major debt apparently. Maybe we can get an
owner willing to spend on a proven rightfielder free agent in the winter.
	Fernando has made the O's as the fifth starter. The O's pitching
staff looks pretty good. Sutcliffe, Mussina, McDonald, Rhodes, and Fernando.
	Baltimore is my pick for the victors in a very competitive AL East.

"And now, I interrupt your regularly scheduled news reading to bring you 
another message sponsored by the Department of Really Mundane Statistics:

I passed the final individual player stats posted here the other day through
a filter to average out games, goals, assists, points, and penalty minutes
for the mythical average NHL pro who played in the league this season. (Why?
Because it's Monday and I didn't feel like writing any REAL code...)

Anyway, after I wiped out the 60-odd goalies in the list, I came up with:

NHL average:		55 GP      11 G      19 A      30 Pts      69 PIM

Then I passed the list through a second time to come up with the players who
had the smallest percentage difference in each of the categories.

Marty McInnis (NYI)	56 GP (1%) 10 G (9%) 20 A (5%) 30 Pts (0%) 24 PIM (65%)
Igor Kravchuk (EDM)	55 GP (0%) 10 G (9%) 17 A (10%) 27 Pts (9%) 27 PIM (53%)

These two are close in games, goals, assists, and points, but are too far off
in PIM. This leaves, as the most average player in the NHL:

Bobby Carpenter (WAS)	65 GP (18%) 11 G (0%) 17 A (10%) 28 Pts (6%) 63 PIM (8%)

What an honor.

I also passed the list through with the goalies still included. Kravchuk and
Carpenter were still in the top three, but Rob DiMaio came flying up from 
behind to take the title:

NHL average:		53 GP      10 G      17 A      27 Pts      64 PIM
Igor Kravchuk (EDM)     55 GP (3%) 10 G (0%) 17 A (0%) 27 Pts (0%) 27 PIM (50%)
Bobby Carpenter (WAS)   65 GP (22%) 11 G (10%) 17 A (0%) 28 Pts (3%) 63 PIM (1%)
Rob DiMaio (TB)		54 GP (1%) 9 G (9%) 15 A (11%) 24 Pts (11%) 62 PIM (3%)


It's all really kind of underwhelming when you think about it.

How extensive is the playoff coverage down there?  In Canada, it is almost

"I believe we are down to two:  the 15-day and the 60-day.  (I don't remember 
a 30-day, but rather a 21-day.  Anyways, it's gone now.)  The period length 
is a minimum, not a maximum.  You can keep a guy on the 15-day for as long 
as you want, IF he's still certified as injured.  The player must be 
periodically re-evaluated to determine if he's still injured (thus you 
cannot park a player on the DL who maybe is out of options and you do not 
wish to expose to waivers).  If you get someone qualified for the 60-day 
that reduces the frequency of re-evaluations.  There is no longer, I 
believe, any limit to the number of players you can place on the DL.  When 
there was, you often had to choose and juggle your injured players between 
the lists.

"The FLYERS team that can beat any team on any night showed up at the Spectrum
Sunday night, and dominated the Maple Leafs thoroughly en route to a 4-0
shutout. Tommy Soderstrom will get credit for the shutout, but he barely broke
a sweat until the third period as the FLYERS defense kept the Leafs from
mounting any serious attack.

Injuries:

Pelle Eklund is day-to-day with a bruised thigh.

Roster Moves:

Jason Bowen was added to the lineup for his first NHL game. Jason was the FLYERS
second pick in the first round (15th overall) of the 1992 entry draft. 19 years
old, 6'4"", 210 lbs. In 62 games with the tri-city Americans he had 10 goals,
12 assists and 219 PIM. He plays left wing and defense, he played defense in
this game although Bobby Taylor said that Bill Dineen was planning to use him
up front as well.

Andre Faust was returned to Hershey. He actually left after the second period
of the Kings game, flew to Albany, got the game tying goal in a Bears OT win,
and played again for Hershey Sunday night.

Lines:

Fedyk-Lindros-Recchi
Beranek-Brind'Amour-Dineen
Lomakin-Butsayev-Conroy
Acton-Brown

Galley-McGill
Yushkevich-Cronin
Carkner-Hawgood

Tommy Soderstrom in goal.

Acton replaced Lomakin in the 3rd period.

Game Summary:

If the FLYERS played like this every night, they'd be in the playoffs this
year. The FLYERS hit everything that moved. They created scoring chance after
scoring chance. They snuffed out everything that the Leafs tried to do.

Jason Bowen made a good play on his first NHL shift that almost created a goal.
He had the puck in the top of the left offensive circle all alone, but instead
of taking the shot he found Brind'Amour crashing the net on the other side.
A perfect pass and a good shot across Daren Puppa's body should have been a
goal, but Puppa made a great save reading the play.

Garry Galley gave the Maple Leafs 7th ranked power play the first chance when
he hooked Doug Gilmour at 4:25. The FLYERS lowly 21st ranked penalty killing
unit was almost flawless the entire game, and set the tone on this kill. The
Maple Leafs got almost nothing but long unscreened shots, and the defense swept
away every rebound.

After the power play, the FLYERS got a goal on an ugly play. Rod Brind'Amour
gave the puck to Greg Hawgood at the right point, and he sent a drive at the
net. Puppa made the save and kicked the rebound right into the feet of Josef
Beranek and Bob Rouse, who were wrestling in the slot. Beranek was able to
get his stick on the puck and push it out to Dineen who was skating into
the slot from the right circle, and he lifted a backhander over Puppa for
a 1-0 FLYERS lead at 8:10.

The FLYERS kept the pressure on, and Puppa was the only Leaf keeping the FLYERS
from building on their lead for a while. Eventually things settled down and
defense prevailed. Each team got an occasional scoring chance, but the goalies
were strong. Bowen started giving some Lindros-like checks in his own corners.
Then Lindros, who was looking to avenge a hit Foligno gave him, thought he had
a chance to even the score. He had Foligno lined up at center ice, leaned into
him, and rode him into the center ice boards. The only problem was that Foligno
was a little far from the boards, and Mike ""Mister"" McGeough felt that it
warranted a boarding call at 15:38

The Leafs couldn't get anything going on the power play as the FLYERS were
very aggressive (for a change) on the kill.

With time running out in the period, Recchi carried through the neutral zone
and handed to Lindros as they approached the Leaf's blue line. They were in
a crowd with Wendell Clark and Jamie Macoun, Lindros tried a backhand pass
to Recchi through the feet of Macoun that connected to Recchi, but then Clark
checked Recchi off the puck. Macoun then tried to clear, but it was weak and
went right to McGill who had manned the point. He drove it from just inside
the blue line. Macoun got his stick on it and deflected it past his own
goalie at 19:55.1. Shots were 13-8 FLYERS in the period.

The FLYERS finally got their first chance on the power play when Dave Andreychuk
tripped up Rod Brind'Amour in his offensive zone. During the power play, the
FLYERS got cheated a little when the puck popped up into the air and Eric
gloved it down, but McGeough thought it hit his stick above his head. We
could see from our seats at the other end of the ice that it only hit his glove
and the replay confirmed, but the faceoff went to the other end. As time was
running out in the advantage, Lindros found Galley with a pass across the goal
mouth but Puppa made the save. The rebound kicked back to the right corner where
Recchi picked it up, passed it out to Eric crashing through the right circle,
and Eric one-timed past Puppa at 7:55. With the assist, Recchi moves past
Bobby Clarke's 74-75 season, the second best one season total for a FLYER at
117.  Eric moves up to 4th all time in FLYERS rookie scoring with 67 points.

Mike Eastwood took down Al Conroy at 8:30 to give the FLYERS another chance on
the power play. Not much pressure before Garry Galley ended the power play with
a slash at 9:19. Not much happened on the 4 on 4, although the Leafs had most
of the possession. The FLYERS smothered the Leafs short power play. Tempers
flared a little at 13:14. Bowen and Pearson got roughing minors, Keith Acton
got a bloody face. Dave McLlwain then took a dive and got Greg Hawgood a
hooking minor at 13:46 to set up a 4 on 3. The replay showed that Hawgood's
stick stopped making contact with McLlwain long before he spun around and fell.
Again the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play, led by Dimitri Yushkevich.
Bowen made a thundering hit when he came out of the box on Pearson. Berehowski
tried to perplex everybody with his sloooowball. He had the puck at the point,
and just trickled a pass down the slot. He made all the FLYERS look silly as
nobody could get a stick on it, and it got to Gilmour at the side of the net,
but Soderstrom stoned him.

The FLYERS picked things up offensively after the kill was over, but didn't
get anything home. Shots were 13-10 FLYERS.

The FLYERS were content with the 3 goal lead in the third period, and they
decided that if Tommy wanted a shutout, he was going to have to work for it a
little.

The FLYERS got most of the scoring chances in the first 7 or so minutes of the
period, but couldn't get past Puppa. Then the Leafs got tired of Lindros making
road kill out of them, and tempers flared. 2 each for Doug Gilmour and Lindros 
(unsportsmanlike conduct) and 2 each for Glenn Anderson and McGill (roughing)
all at 7:02. Terry Carkner then took a kneeing penalty at 7:51 on Gilmour.

Again the FLYERS smothered the Leafs power play.

At about the 12 minute mark, Dave Andreychuk got a shot away from his left
circle that got through Soderstrom. The puck was rolling on it's side, and
as luck would have it it turned away from the net instead of turning towards
it (think of how a rolling quarter inevitably starts to lean one way or the
other). Seconds later Rod Brind'Amour tripped up Gilmour at 12:24 to give the
Leafs another chance on the power play. On the advantage, after Soderstrom
stoned Andreychuk while lying down, Andreychuk got the rebound through
Soderstrom, but from behind the net and it went straight through and was swept
away by one of his defensemen. They kept the pressure on, but Soderstrom was
equal and preserved the shutout.

Recchi cross checked Ken Baumgartner to get tempers hot and start a brawl
at 16:01. No punches thrown, Recchi got the initial minor, Krushelnyski
Baumgartner and Lindros each got roughing minors. At 17:02 Rouse and Beranek
expressed their mutual dislike for each other and got 2 each for slashing to
set up another 4 on 4. Mike Eastwood shoved down Ryan McGill in the FLYERS
zone as they were battling for the puck, and while McGill was down he ran
his stick across McGill's face. The FLYERS were not happy with that at all.
5-8 Al Conroy paired up with 6-1 Berehowski, and started throwing punches.
Upward. Well, Al held his own, much to the delight of the crowd. Each got
a couple punches in before going down in a head, and Al got a standing O!
Penalties: Eastwood 5 (cross check) + game, Clark, Carkner 10 each. Berehowski
and Conroy 5 each (fighting) at 17:49.

So a major penalty for the rest of the game for the FLYERS. The had no interest
in stting on the lead. Hawgood, Galley and Brind'Amour played catch until
Hawgood found Dineen all alone in the left circle, he controlled the puck and
blasted it past Puppa at 18:39.

That was all the fireworks, Tommy Soderstrom would not face another shot. Puppa
did, but kept the FLYERS off the board. 4-0 FLYERS, shots were 9-8 FLYERS in the
3rd. Probably the strongest game I've seen from the FLYERS since the All Star
break. Shutout number 4 for Soderstrom, all since 1/10. Tied for 2nd most in
the NHL, but he's played fewer games than Belfour (6) or the goalie I can't
remember that he's tied with.

Next up it's the Winnipeg Selannes Tuesday night in Winnipeg. The FLYERS cannot
be eliminated if they win, but a loss coupled with an Islander win that night
in Washington would be the official end.

FLYERS up to 71 points on the season in 78 games. Last year they had 75 points
in 80 games (5 under .500), so they need at least 8 points in their last 6
games to improve on that only by percentage points (5 under in 84 is better
than 5 under in 80).

Tragic number holds at 3 points with 6 games left. The tragic number for 5th
is 5 points, I watched the Rangers blow a 4-2 third period lead at home to
lose 5-4 before I finished this up. Why 5 points instead of 4? Well, the FLYERS
will win the tie-breaker if they catch them, whereas the Islanders win tie
breakers against the FLYERS and so need only a tie. The Rangers could crumble
down the stretch as they play the Devils, the Pens twice, the FLYERS, and
finish up with 2 games against the Caps. So I guess 5th place could be the
goal for the team to focus on.

Traditional baseball stats have gotten way too far away from methods
which enable fans to see who contributes to those runs scored - that's
where OBP, SLG, Runs Created, Linear Weights, etc. come in.  These
simplify matters so that we can more easily measure a player's
offensive contribution to the team's runs scored.

Thank you for making our case.  Have a nice day.",sports

  Actually, what I think has become more evident, is that you are determined to
  flaunt your ignorance at all cost.  Jagr did not have a better season than
  Francis ... to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of
  hockey knowledge.  Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty
  plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.

  Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice
  time per game and some measure of its ""quality"" (i.e., is the player put out
  in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up
  against the other team's top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), I would
  much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious
  merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.

This is what Jackson looked like in 88-91, with everything converted
to a neutral park, on the basis of run production. His equivalent
average started at .253 in 88, was up to .274 in 89 and 286 in 90. So
let us say he had established, in his last two seasons, a .280 level
of play.

That is good. Very good, in fact. But it probably doesn't make the top
ten in the league. The 10th best EQA in the AL in 1992 was Dave
Winfield's .296; Thomas was first at .350. First in the NL was Bonds,
an incroyable .378; tenth was Bip Roberts, .297. But .280 is better
than any season in the past five years by Joe Carter; it is about what
Mattingly had in 1988 (.285); what Felix Jose had the last two years;
just ahead of Time Raines' five-year average; better than Ryan
Klesko's MLEs. 

He got more attention from the media than was warranted from his
baseball playing, though; his hype was a lot better than his hitting.
That is the basis for the net.comments about him being overrated. The
media would have you beleive he was a great hitter. I think he was a
good, maybe very good hitter. He was IMO, something like the 30th best
hitter in the majors.",sports
"I think that NHLPA' 93 is the best video game available now.

and making scorers from the same team compete for the top scoring:
Yesterday I won the title using Toronto against Hartford (4 games to two),
I played the playoffs in a 7 games fashion (5 minutes for each period) and
the best scorer and shooter was Gilmour (116 shots if I remember well)

Sorry, Nelson, but you forgot to ask me. If you check the THN stats for
Kansas City, you'll find that Larry has been playing for the games, having
played in 8 games in the period covered in the stats between 3/26 and the
4/16 issue (1-3-4 with 13 PIM). Not exactly invisible.


Well, having gotten to a chance to talk to him a few times, this isn't quite
accurate. He injured his back (a disk injury) and did one stupid thing,
which was to hide it from the Sharks and he tried to play through it because
he knew he was on the bubble. The Sharks then sent him to K.C., at which
point he disclosed the injury. Since he didn't disclose it, the Sharks and
he disagreed about the responsibility and he was suspended for not
reporting. That was eventually worked out, the Sharks re-instated him as
injured and put him into therapy, and when he was able to play then shipped
him down to K.C. He fully expects to play in the NHL again, although clearly
not with the Sharks (hiding injuries is a stupid no-no, beyond just a
no-no).

Very nice guy. Always hustled his butt off. He disappeared because he was
hurt. I expect he'll surface with another team at some point (probably
another expansion team), but is likely to be a bubble player for the rest of
his career. Has a good work ethic and is good at getting other players
motivated. Unfortunately, he played himself out of the Sharks future with a
bad judgement call.




Always gave 110%, best work ethic on the club (except maybe Kisio), but
hustle isn't always enough. His future with the Sharks was made clear to me
one night against the Flames when he went behind the crease and tried to
hold Joel Otto against the board. He literally had one arm around Otto's
neck and another wrapped around Otto's stick arm. Otto casually turned
around and fed the puck in front of the crease for a goal, as though Carter
wasn't there. Hustle can only cover size so far.

The Sharks have told me, point blank, that he's gone for good (ditto HUbie
McDonough). He was one of the favorites of the staff, but as one said to me
""you have to make room for the kids"". Carter, in fact, refused to report to
K.C. and has been suspended by the Sharks. That might be a defacto
retirement, but I haven't heard anything official. His only hope in hockey
now is the Gulls.



Because, at least from the games I saw him in, he was outmatched and looked
fairly lost on the ice. I think he shows potential, but I didn't think he
was quite ready to make the jump to the NHL.


Agreed (BTW, I still think a lot of your grades are more based on how you
wish they'd performed than how they actually performed. I wonder whether you
can really judge talent from radio and television, Nelson? I know I have
trouble, since you don't see the off-puck action. your views from home and
my views from the ice differ in numerous ways)



Coffee. Coffey is with the Red Wings.



You? Nah... 

He was seriously unimpressive, even as a tough guy (his rep). However, as
few games as he had in a season that was at that point meaningless, I hate
to judge the talent too quickly. Butn in Dody's case, I""m tempted to make an
exception.

But I won't.

"Off and on over the last several months, threads about RBIs and
related topics have gotten me to thinking about how well we can 
predict a player's RBIs using information about his overall
performance and the number of runners in scoring position (RISP)
that he bats with.  In the Brock2 model, Bill James calculated
predicted RBIs as RBI=.235*(Total Bases) + Home Runs.  This 
completely ignores the context, which was all that Brock2 
could do, since context was unknown to it.  So I thought I'd
take that idea as a starting point and look how good a fit to
the data you get by comparing (RBI-Home Runs) to SLG*RISP.

I've started with team data, using data from the Elias's that
I've picked up over the years when a) I could afford them and
b) I could stomach the thought of increasing Elias's profits.
That gave me the years 1984-1986, 1988, and 1990.  (I don't 
have team RBIs for '87 or I could add that year.)  If you
run a simple least squares fit to the data you get 

(RBI-Home Runs) = 0.81*SLG*RISP.

The correlation between the LHS and the RHS is 0.86, which is
significant at a ridiculously high level.  So, I feel like the
fit is good at the team level.  I've no started to move on to 
the player level and have looked at 4 players (Will Clark,
Ozzie Smith, Joe Carter, and Don Mattingly).  I hope to 
add quite a few more during my copious free time this year.

It doesn't do too badly, except the equation underpredicts the
low HR hitter (Smith), which may be a fault of the model or it
could just be Ozzie.  The results:

                           RBI-HR
         Years        Actual   Predicted
Carter  (84-88,90)     400       402.6
Clark   (87,88,90,92)  269       269.6
Matt'ly (84-88,90)     471       460.8
Smith   (84-88,90)     317       280.6

I think we can make a case (and I hope to make it stronger) that
RBIs can be predicted simply from knowing how a player slugs overall
and how many men are in scoring position when he comes up.

"From another not-so-distressed-but-still-wondering-about-a-few-things
Cardinal fan:

	He's not the greatest - this is true.
	I saw it.
	Lankford was hurt, although the announcer said he told Torre he
	could pinch hit if they needed him to.
	I wondered the same thing.  But giving Joe the benefit of the 
	doubt, I'd say he was thinking that Lankford is hurt enough that
	he didn't trust his ability to bat effectively but he wants his
	speed on the bases so pinch run him.  Alicea I was completely
	confused about.  Maybe he had a good record hitting against that
	particular pitcher?  I don't know.  Anybody got an idea?
	Well, so far I haven't seen much to say Whiten shouldn't be playing
	but it is too bad that Gilkey is the odd man out when they play 
	Jordan ahead of him.  That I don't quite understand.
	Yup, I looked for this on the replay too.  If I'm Joe Torre, I'm
	going to have a talk with Bucky after the game on that one.  He's
	got Lankford at third with Todd Zeile I believe - a hot hitter - 
	coming up - there's no reason to risk giving Lankford the go sign 
	in that situation unless he was sure the ball is going to the stands.  
	It's his job to watch the play develop - he should have known Larkin 
	was there to back up a bad throw.  That seemed inexcusable in my book.  
	BTW, I saw Dent do the same thing last year with Zeile rounding third 
	and going into a sure out at home in a critical situation.  On the 
	replay, there's Dent waving him around.  It looks like this might be a 
	serious problem.  The Card's weren't good base runners at all last year 
	and I wonder how much of the fault lies in the base coaching.

	Well, I'm still hanging in there.

I wouldn't give baserunning that much value.

The above effect is clear, but there are other effects as well.  If
Olerud hits a double, any runner on first will score; if Alomar legs an
extra base onto a hit in the gap, the runner on first may need to hold
at third.  Thus Olerud's doubles have more advancement value than
Alomar's.  (Of course, Alomar is more likely to score after hitting a
double.)

Another reason not to give too much extra value to baserunning is that
the runs created formulas work for very fast and very slow teams.  No
team in the 1950's ran much, but some teams certainly had faster players
than others.  Still, the current runs created formulas work just as well
in the 1950's for all teams.  

Bill James gives the 1955-1958 Senators as an example.  They used Harmon
Killebrew regularly as a pinch runner, and in 1957, stole 13 bases with
38 times caught stealing.  Yet they scored slightly more runs than
predicted by Runs Created.

The biggest advantage that kids from Boondock or Weedville have is the
availability of ice.  In the San Jose area we have a population of 800,000
and that population is served by 2 ice arenas.  In contrast, Kamloops,
British Columbia has a population of about 50,000 and has 5 rinks!  There
are also myriad ponds, pools, etc that freeze in the winter.  Down here
it's hard to find a kid without a bicycle; up there it's hard to find a kid
without a pair of skates.  And before you say ""what does he know? He's from
California."" let me say that I was born and raised in Trail, British Columbia,
a town of about 8,000 with lots of ice in the winter.  My father did radio
play by play for the local team, the Trail Smokeaters, who by  the way, were
the last Canadian team to win the World Championship (back in 1961).  I was
on skates almost as soon as I could walk, and have been playing recreational
hockey for about 35 years.



Lack of ice is a big factor, but costs is a bigger factor.  Both my kids play for
the Santa Clara Valley Hockey Association and this season, which just ended,
cost me $75 per kid for membership in Hockey USA, plus $750 per kid for club
dues.  The Hockey USA fees cover excess medical insurance, and the club dues
cover ice time, officials, trophies, etc.  Other areas have similar fees, unless
the city government subsidises some of the costs, as Stockton does.

By the way; most ice arenas are located in what could be called the ""inner city""
areas.  Eastridge and Vallco are exceptions ... Redwood City's rink is in an
industrial area on Bay Rd, near 101, Berkeley's is near Ashby and Martin Luther
King, Stockton's is in Oak Park, Sacramento's is in an older section of downtown
(I forget the name of the street), Fresno's is out on the edge of town, just west
of 99.  Santa Rosa's is a nice rink, but it's in an older section of town.
Dublin's is outside of town, off 580.  Most of the rinks are old, and expensive
to run, with huge electric bills and insurance premiums.  If you want to buy ice
time expect to pay around $100 per hour at any of these rinks.  Some of them
give you a 60 minute hour for your money; others give you a 50 minute hour and
include the resurfacing time in the fee.

up by the Ack-people during spring training due to the fact that his

Most of the points you made about Lopez v. Berryhill/Olson have been
made by others, and realizing that Lopez must be the second coming of
Frank Thomas, I have relented and praised the unmistakeable wisdom of
his supporters.


See?  This is essentially what everyone was doing  -  comparing Lopez
to one of the best players in the game.  I'm really looking forward
to seeing this can't-miss superstar now.  As for Thomas, I remember
being an advocate of his being brought up in 1990 even though he was
only 21 or 22 (can't remember).  But who did the Sox have at first?
Calderon?  Martinez?  Kittle?  The spot was there.  The talent was
there.  Sure, I say go for it.

I am not convinced that Lopez is anywhere near as talented as Thomas
was after his AA season in 1989, and I am not convinced that Olson/
Berryhill are nearly as bad as Kittle/Martinez were.

BTW, I don't think Thomas was hurt by those three months.






Well, if we can't compare our guy to one of the best in the game,
let's compare our decision to one of the most ""Boneshead"", right?

Cal Eldred was 24 when he came up, with a full season at AAA and a
longer minor league career.  Frankly, I don't know why he didn't
make the club in 1992.  Bones is a year younger with a lousy prior
history, and just watching him makes me think that I missed a 
career as a big-league pitcher.  No one -  I repeat NO ONE  -
laughed louder than I did at the Sheffield trade.  (Though I guess
Mieske has a future.)

(I take it back. McIlvaine may have laughed louder.)

John Davidson(color) and Mark Jones as a roaming reporter.
This telecast will be seen in the Western USA.

Montreal's naitive,Jon Saunders will be hosting in the studio.

ABC will do ""Up and Close and Personal"" with Mario during Saturday's
Wide World of Sports(4:30EDT).

Sunday will be the first NHL playoff or regular network telecast in 13 years...
not counting those silly All-Star games on NBC for the last few years...

For Sunday's games,ABC will use 8 mikes(2 behind on the goal),super-super-slo-mo,
close-ups of player's faces at face-offs. ESPN/ABC will not be able to
use its new favorite toy,the ice-level shot, in Pittsburgh where too many
seats would have to removed to employ it...


In case of a blowout in progress in Pittsburgh,ABC will switch to Chicago
game but will come back to the Pittsburgh game for updates or if the game
gets closer(Ha!)..

are involved - NY metro area(NY Islanders/NJ Devils),Chicago(BlackHawks),

"Everyone keeps talking about European expansion by 2010 thinking
wishful thoughts, but being totally off the ball.

The league format we use here is incompatible with that in Europe.
(for those that don't know, the best teams from lower divisions get
promoted and the worst get demoted).

Would European fans put up with our ""if you've paid, you can play"" 
attitude??

How long would they support teams that are run on Ranger-based 
corporate thinking (I use the term lightly).  (We don't need a good
product because these duffuses in NYC would fill the arena for Ottawa's
record every year......1940!! haha (sorry, had ta say it)).

If hockey (and other pro sports) had a similar system to Europe, maybe
teams like the Rangers would be forced to compete (or get demoted the fourth 
division).  We'd have many more teams...centres that aren't as big (like
Halifax or Adirondack....ok, so Halifax isn't a good example) would 
eventually get promoted, and every team would be somewhat competetive within
its own division (unlike Ottawa, SJ, Edmonton, etc.). Fans would eventually
get rewarded for their loyalty (or penalized for their neglect), and the
league would be more interesting and dynamic every year because of the influx
of newly promoted teams (and the Halifax Citadels win the Stanley Cup...I can
dream, can't I??)

Look at British (or any European) soccer as an example (they never have fan
problems).

Well, OBP is the most important offensive statistic, and by a big margin.
50 points of OBP is worth considerably more than 50 points of slugging.
That being said, I still think Baerga was VERY SLIGHTLY better last year,
but I think this is as close to a wash as you're likely to find.

I personally don't care much for Alomar's defense.  I don't think he's
nearly as good as people make him out to be, and he can't turn the DP
to save his life.  He comes across the bag improperly, and his release
is slow.  Considering the high leverage of the DP, this is a shortcoming
I can't overlook.  In the long term, I'd move Alomar to another position.

If the Jays could trade a hot Devon White for something, I'll be Alomar

Living in the Bay area, I do not get enough Leaf coverage
to pull something out of the bag,  (I would appreciate comments

idea...

Andreychuck and Borchevsky have no business playing against

any presence within 3-stick lengths of the slot.  Where the
hell is Anderson?  Anderson can (in days past) get under peoples
skin.  Put a little more bluntly, Anderson has to be an asshole.
He used to be good at it.  We need him now.  

Perhaps, perhaps the Leafs can shut down Detroit's second line.
I was dissappointed to see Shepard and Yserbeart flying last night.
These guys are the ""swing"" players for the Wings.  Last year they
did a major choke in the playoffs and were to blame for the quick
exit of the Wings.  **THis has to happen again**.   Clark-Anderson-Gilmour
should be able to out hustle this line.  Anderson should do a
nasty on Yserbeart.  Clark should bang the hell out of Sheppard.  
Score Gilmour score!

Suggestions:  Clarke-Anderson-Gilmour vs. Sheppard-Yserbeart-??
	      Andreychuck-Borchevsy-??  vs. Detroit checking line
	      Toronto's checking line  vs. Yzerman-Fedorov-Probert (pray lots)

* as suggested - i would bench Andreychuck and Borchevsky to stir things up
		 and through a monkey wrench into Detroits game plan.  However,
		if the Detroit coaching would be dumb enough to play their
		checking line against these ""finesse"" players - well then
		let them play.

** Potvin can not be faulted on 5 of the goals - keep him in.
** Van Hellamond can not be faulted for the Leafs demise either.
** The Wings defense shut down the Leafs (especially in the slot).

I hope Pat Burns realizes that his team was out-hit, out-skated, and
out-coached on Monday night.  This was not a loss because of poor goaltending
or officiating.  This calls for drastic measures ... or tee off is next Monday.

Well, actually, most of ours is based on what really happened and yours is
based on some fantasy of how it happened. But that's OK, I understand you
have a hockey background. Stats like ""plus/minus"" make RBI look good.


OK, how about a straigh answer, then. Here's a very simele question to which
I'm sure a fair number of us are very interesed in the answer to. Please
answer yes or no, Roger:
 Can a pitcher cause the offensive players on his team to score more runs?
AL only, please.

For anyone else following along, it is a well-known and demonstrable fact
that a team's win-loss record is closely related to the number of runs the
team scores and the number the team allows. It's not a definite,
hard-and-fast function, but there is definitely a correlation. In fact, as a
rule of thumb, if teams A and B both score X runs and team A allows Y runs,
for every 10 runs fewer than Y that team B allows, it will win another game.
So, for instance, if we look at the 1991 Toronto Blue Jays, we find that
they scored 780 runs and allowed 682, of which Morris allowed 114. All other
things being equal, if Frank Viola, with his 3.44 ERA had replaced Jack
Morris for the 240.2 innings Morris threw (plausible, since Viola threw 238
for Boston), the ""Red Jays"" would have allowed about 15 fewer runs, or
enough for 1-2 more wins. Now, that doesn't take into account that Viola
pitched half his innings in Fenway, which is a harder park to pitch in
(particularly for a lefthander) than Skydome. So, um, Roger. Unless you
really do believe that a pitcher can somehow affect the number of runs
his team scores, could you enlighten us to the fallacy in this
analysis? Clearly, it would be foolhardy to claim that Viola would
necessarily have put up a 3.44 if he had been on the Jay last year, but
that is not the claim. We look at what the actual performances were and
evaluate Viola's as better than Morris' in the sense that ""had Morris

This is true, but not so open that your brain falls out.

The FAN is an okay Sports Radio station, but doesn't come close to
the ULTIMATE in Sports Radio, 610 WIP in Philadelphia.  The signal
might not be as powerful, but then again only stations in New York
feel ""obligated"" to pollute everyone else's airwaves with a bunch of
hoodlum Mets fans complaining 24 hours a day.  WIP took two of your
best sports jockeys too, Jody MacDonald and Steve Fredericks.  610
WIP is rockin with sports talk from 5:30 AM till midnight, check it
out anytime your within a few hours of Philadelphia.  If I'm not
mistaken, WIP has the highest sports talk ratings in the nation?

"Here is the OPI (Offensive Production Index) for all AL players with at
least 10 at bats.

It is early in the season so there are some very high numbers.  Last years
leader was Frank Thomas at 0.682.

Teams are denoted by an * as the first character of the name and each
player has his team preceeding his name.

The equations used are found at the end of the post.

Comments and suggestions are welcome.

It's just as meaningless to compare goals, assists, PIM and any other stat I
can think of.  Each player is asked to take a unique role for his team.  The
contexts will never be the same from one player to another playing on the
same team or different teams.  And yet ... awards are given and promotions
received based in part on these meaningless stats.  The operative words are
""in part"" - stats must be interpreted, tempered with other information one
has about the player.  



And comparing Jagr's and Francis's points is just as ridiculous and absurd...
but not more ridiculous and absurd as comparing goals, assists, points, +\-
for Selanne, Lindros, Juneau, Potvin, and the other rookies in the league...
and yet...

     The Giants always hit Maddux well, but it was interesting that Maddux
did not pitch around Bonds to get to Clayton last night.  He threw 2 straight
fastballs over the plate to Bonds in the 1st last night, got away with the
first one, but Bonds hit the second one out of the park.  Then in the 3rd,
when Clark was at third base with one out, Maddux did not intentionally
walk Bonds, and Bonds dropped a single to left-center.

     The Braves announcers pointed out that McGee as a leadoff hitter has
not scored a run yet.  He will always hit around .300, but I'm concerning
about his on-base percentage.  The key in the lineup is Matt Williams, he
has to stay hot so that Bonds can hit with runners on base.



     The pitching gets a set back as Bud Black is placed on the DL.  Burba
has done a superb job filling in so far, he looks like a different pitcher
from last year.  However, Swift is terrible in both of his starts.  With
Burba moving into the rotation, Mike Jackson is the only right-handed
reliever aside from Rod Beck, he'll get a lot of actions.  I also hope that
Dusty can manage his bullpen better than Roger Craig, especially on Beck.
I was concerned when Beck was used for 3 straight days earlier this week.



     So far so good!

"I don't know if you could call him rushed, but ""Big"" Ben McDonald didn't
much time at all in the minors. Of course that was because the balls used
in AAA had seams too large and gave McDonald blisters forcing him to go
on the DL several times. He's done most of his learning here in the majors.
Of course Gregg ""Wild Thing"" Olson and Mike ""Deserved a Cy Young"" Mussina
didn't spend much time in the minors either. I read somewhere that pitchers
are less likely to need that much time in the minors anyway so maybe that
has something to do with it.
Let's go O's! Why Not?

"
Last night during a Sharks' broadcast, Commissioner Bettman was
interviewed during the first intermission.  He made no bones about it,
the expansion to 28 is on permanent hold until he is satisfied that
the current allotment of 26 are fully stable.  This means that cities
looking for a club in the foreseeable future will have to wait until
one team in some location fails or looks to relocate.

This is good, IMO.  There's no sense in expanding if it only means
more failing franchises are in the mold.",sports

Bryan Murray has done very little as GM...Yzerman, Fedorov, Cheveldae,
Chaisson, the whole Russian strategy was a product of the previous
GM...Murray has made a couple of decent trades...that's about it...
that would hardly rank him as the best GM.

Wasn't Primeau, Murray's first decision as GM...",sports

Jagr has a higher +/-, but Francis has had more points.  And take it from
an informed observer, Ronnie Francis has had a *much* better season than
Jaromir Jagr.  This is not to take anything away from Jaro, who had a 
decent year (although it didn't live up to the expectations of some).

Not if you've scored four runs, you don't!  Why strain even the best pitching
staff?  Why not make it easier for them?  

In the 2-1 game, the best pitching staff in the world can't compensate
for a blown call, a bad hop, a gust of wind.  Winning close is the 
wrong way to win; both keeping opposing runs down AND scoring a lot 
yourself are insurance against the ""Shit happens"" aspect of baseball.

Not every great teamhas even *good* pitching.  The Big Red Machine of
the 70's was league-average in pitching.  But somehow, Rose-Morgan-Bench-
Perez-etc. managed to win 100 games more than once, peaking at 108.",sports

"Well put, Jason.  I am not from Wisconsin, but I have close relatives who
live in Port Washington (about 30 minutes north of Milwaukee), I visit the
city regularly, and I have been in the Bradley four times to see the Admirals
play  and the NCAA Hockey Championships.  It is a beautiful building.  The
Pettits and the city like to promote it as the best facility for hockey in
North America.
As to what will happen with the Admirals if Milwaukee does acquire a
franchise, word is the team will move to Green Bay and play in the Brown
County Arena.
Once again, the Admirals are an independent franchise, and the people of
Milwaukee have been supporting them well.  The games I have been to have seen
crowds anywhere from 10,000 to 13,000, which are numbers some NHL teams (i.e.
the Islanders, Hartford, New Jersey) would be envious of having on some nights.
Plus the fact that the city is able to support a minor league franchise without
the glamour of having an NHL club affiliated to it is testimony to the amount
of hockey interest exists in the city.

He's been playing horrible defense. Baylor said after Wednesday's game that
he wanted to shake up the lineup a little, because Bichette has been
having a rough time defensively and Jerald Clark has not been hitting.
He was true to his word; I went to Thursday's game and Gerald Young
was in right and Daryl Boston (who has a very hot bat) was in left.
Baylor was careful to say though that he didn't necessarily mean for
these changes to be permanent but he wanted to give these other two
a shot while Clark and Bichette were not playing well.

In defense of Bichette, it looks like right field in Mile High Stadium
is a bitch to play. Some of the visiting outfielders have been having
some problems too (although Bobby Bonilla made a great catch crashing into
the wall to rob Daryl Boston of an extra base hit in Thursday's game)",sports

Are there any further stories to report on the eve' of Norm's farewell

Green was given until midnight of the last home-game of the North Stars
to cleanup his belongings and turn in the keys to the arena. 
Did this happen? Was Norm run-out-of-town?

Rumor has it that while he was attempting to remove the score board, 
the score-board fell to the ice and flattened Mr. Greedy to a large
piece of green paper. Arena management had to use the Zamboni (which 
they confiscated from Norm's truck) to clean-up the useless remains. ",sports

Maine beat LSSU 5-4 in Milwaukee on Saturday night.  It was quite a game.
Maine stormed to a 2-0 lead in the first and looked like they might run away
with it.  Maine's first goal came inside the first thirty seconds of the game.
LSSU came back at the end of the period to cut the lead to 2-1.

LSSU came out in the second dominating the play particularly along the boards.
The play went quickly with the refs running a no-holds-barred type of game.
LSSU scored three more unanswered goals to lead 4-2 at the end of the second.
Now it looked like LSSU might just walk away with the game.

Coach Walsh, of Maine, replaced the starting goalie Dunham with Snow, who won
the game against Michigan.  Snow proved to be a much more aggressive goalie.
The third period, like the second, belonged to the team behind.  Maine scored
three unanswered goals in a span of five minutes after the four minute mark.
They were all scored by Jim Montgomery, the tournament MVP, and all assisted by
Paul Kariya.

The last minute of the game bears highlighting.  The change to Snow also
proved the difference in the end.  With one minute to go and with the LSSU
goalie pulled, Snow dueled with a LSSU forward in a amazing set of moves by
both.  Snow won.  It was a great way to end the game.

"Way back in the early years (~50's) it took 8 wins to garner the Stanley Cup. 
Soooooo, a couple of local fish mongers (local to the Joe Louis Arena, that is)

each victory, one leg would be severed before the octopus found its way to the

shore up the demand for one of their least popular products.

Frankly, no.  Offense and defense are equally important.  But the
pitcher is 80% of the defense.  The primary role of every other player

a non-entity ...


We're getting the Sabres-Bruins as the replacement game (and probably
so are you) while the Devils-Penguins game is played on SCNY and the
Islanders-Caps are the overflow game on the SCA (SCNY Plus).  If the
Sabres-Bruins ends early then we'll go to the Devils-Penguins game
(assuming that ESPN follows their previous patterns; we got the last
minute of the Islanders-Rangers and all of the overtime two weeks
ago).  ESPN's coverage started last night, by accident, but as one
or more other writers have pointed out, they could've gone to wild
hog wrestling for the evening instead ...

Assuming you're serious, I guess you'd be surprised to hear
that us GUYS don't think so. I would guess that a tiny fraction
of 1% of the folks reading your post agree with it. I kind of
doubt that even you agree with it.

I'm not going to go through your points one at a time, because, 
after all, not many of them have anything at all to do with baseball.

I'm only replying to this because you brought up Pam Postema, the
AAA umpire who sued (is suing?) baseball on the grounds of sex
discrimination because she wasn't promoted to the majors.


I've never seen her ump a game. I have no first hand experience
with her ability as an umpire.

But I have seen her on talk shows. And her point seems to be
that she can call balls and strikes as well as any of the
umpires and she knows the rulebook better than most. It seems
to me that she is missing the point and if that's how she sees
the role of umpires in the game, well I wouldn't promote her
either.

The umpires primary role has nothing to do with calling baserunners
safe or out; hell, Joe Lundy could do that. Their primary function is
to maintain order in the game, keep the game moving, and keep the
players from trying to kill each other. 

Umpires have to be extremely tough people. That disqualifies most
of us, both men and women. And if Ms. Postema thinks that she
deserves to be a major league umpire because of her command of
the rulebook, then I think that disqualifies her as well. Umpires
need to command the game; command of the rulebook is secondary.

Vancouver vs. Winnipeg - Jets in 7
The Jets have played the Canucks tough the last three games.  Everyone is
healthy for the Jets.  I'm biased.  :)

Calgary vs. Los Angeles - Flames in 6
From what I have seen, the Kings have looked flat lately.  I just can't see
them getting by the Flames.

Final- Jets in 6.
The Jets haven't lost to the Flames in '93.  They will, but it will be a
close series that will come down to how well Roberts has recovered.  I
don't think he'll be 100%, and while it will help, it won't be enough.

---------------

Chicago vs. St. Louis/Minnesota
Chicago in 6 against the Blues, 7 against the Stars.  

Detroit vs. Toronto - Wings in 6.
The Wings should be able to shutdown Gilmour and Andreychuk.  Chelvadae is
more experienced than Potvin.

Final - Hawks in 7.  Brutal series.  Probert and Chelios will go at it.
Belfour is better than Chelvadae, IMHO.

and that will carry them through to the final.

I think the Caps can beat the Isles, but not the Devils.  Tabaracci has been
strong in goal, and if he plays like last year, he could carry the team.
It doesn't matter, though.

"1st round: 
----------

PITT vs NYI:  PITT in 4. 

It looks like a safe bet.  NYI has been bagging it of late.
NYI and NJD have a showdown Friday night for the honour
of Pittsburg anyway.  Pigsburg in 4.

WASH vs NJD:  WASH in 6. 
I think that NJD have a solid team and will compete with
WASH.  I agree though with WASH in 6.

BOS  vs BUF:  BOS  in 5. 
The B's have been playing awesome hockey in the last
two weeks.  The only question is how long will it last?
Fuhr is a dud.  BOS in 4.

QUE  vs MON:  MON  in 7.
It seems to me that MON is much like the VAN - no chemistry.
The Habs seem to be not in stride. QUE in 5.  

CHI  vs STL:  CHI in 4. 
STL should not be in the playoffs. CHI in 4.

DET  vs TOR:  DET in 6.
I am a diehard Leaf fan but ... It seems that the Leafs
offense is shutting down in the last week.  Can they
turn it around against Detroit.  As I recall, the last
couple of time these two teams met, the Leafs were pummelled.
I don't know if Bobbie is allowed in Canada yet.  If he is,
DET in 5.  If not, DET in 6.

VAN  vs WIN:  WIN in 6.

Upset in the making here.  Another team with bad chemistry.
There is something gone foul among Linden, Momesso and Bure.
WIN in 6.

CAL  vs  LA:  CAL in 5.
Anybody that says that LA could possibly beet CAL does
not watch the Smythe a whole lot.  LA is a bunch of Geritols.
CAL in 4.


2nd round: 
----------

PITT vs WASH: PITT in 4. 
It seems to me that Pigsburg has some egos on their team.  Their
saving grace though is Bowman.  He can put anybody in their place.
However, if PIGS have a quick first round, they may be a little
too high.  WASH could be there for a surprise.  Having said that,
I will say PITT in 6.

BOS  vs MON:  BOS  in 6.
MON will not be there.  BOS is surprising me of late. Cam is great.
The couple of wins against QUE last week have sold me with the
B's.  B's in 6.


CHI  vs DET:  CHI  in 7.
Yikes.  This will not be pretty.  But DET is running like a machine
of late.  They've had a non-busy end of the season in which they played
like killers.  DET in 6.

WIN  vs CAL:  CAL  in 5.
CAL has a solid team, a little weak in the nets.  CAL will out
muscle WIN.  CAL in 5.

3rd round: 
----------

PITT vs BOS:  PITT in 5. 

I hate PITT.  My logic eludes me.  The dark side will take over
and give BOS the extra push it needs to dump PITT.  There may
be something to this - if you think of the rivalry.  BOS in 7.
CHI  vs CAL:  CHI  in 5. 

Finals:
------

PITT vs CHI: PITT in 5. 

NO, no, no.  We have BOS vs DET.  I don't know what to say
here.  Both teams will be flying and overdue.  I will go
with goaltending and muscle and say DET in 7.

Not really, though I wouldn't personally say ""the most deserving
candidate wins"".  Rarely does a player win ROY when called up in mid
season, and there have been several duds in recent years.  But this is
more a factor of mediot biases than anything else.  (I wonder.  If
Amaral hits like he is capable of, will he receive ROTY votes?  He's
only 31, he could have a long career ahead of him!  :-)


I think they are a second-division team.  They should finish ahead of
the Royals, Mariners, and *possibly* Athletics.  But I don't think
they'll be above .500.  (I think the East is stronger this year.)

Last year their pitching was bad and their offense was horrible.  This
year their offense is better, but their pitching is still pretty bad.
Even if Finley returns to form, he won't replace what they lost in
Abbott.  Sanderson?  Farrell?  I don't believe it.

And while their BA may be good, and they have decent speed, their
offense lacks punch.  They don't have any bona fide power hitters.
(Salmon, Snow, Davis, and Curtis?  None with more than 20 HR
potential.)

Well, had you been a bit less exuberant in both the tone and substance of
your predictions, the responses would probably have been a bit more
measured. Be that as it may....

Clemens is always in this form, and Viola isn't really performing beyond
what might reasonably have been expected. How do you know that the Sox are
responding to them, and not to Al Bumbry, Hobson, or (my most likely
suspect) new hitting coach Mike Easler? I certainly am more likely to give
Easler credit for Mo Vaughhn's hot start than Clemens or Viola.

This was the optimistic scenario, but not unreasonably so. He hasn't shown
much power yet, though.

How can you tell that Dawson is providing the leadership? Perhaps it's
Calderon? Perhaps it's Clemens and Viola? Maybe Hobson is finally showing
those people skills he was supposed to have when they hired him. Or maybe
it's all a myth. And Dawson has been hitting reasonably well, but not as
well as Greenwell, Vaughn, Cooper, or Fletcher.

In three games. Why don't we look at this one again in, say, July?

A bit better than could reasonably have been expected. But don't forget that
Zupcic looked like Wade Boggs lite for about 75 AB's last year. Beware of
small sample sizes. Still, if Fletcher hits as well as he did last year he'd
be a great improvement over any Sox leadoff hitter from last year. Be aware
that his career numbers seem to indicate that he puts up good numbers as
long as he doesn't have to make more than 300 AB or so in a year.

Ummm...sorry, no. I can buy the ""in the field"" part, and I think he'll be
better at the plate than the 1992 Boggs, but in general Cooper, while he'll
be a pretty good hitter, couldn't carry Boggs' jockstrap. With a little
luck, he could be the fourth or fifth best 3B in the AL (Martinez, Boggs,
Ventura, and Palmer will all be better).


See, here is where you make that quick left turn off into the aether. .500
is plausible, third is not unlikely, but phrases like ""could run away with
the division"" are likely to get you a visit from the men in the white
coats. It's not really clear that their staff is better than last year. If
Russell does well, Darwin doesn't go on the DL, and Hesketh doesn't pitch
just barely well enough to avoid losing his spot in the rotation, they could
be better. On the other hand, if Hesketh pitches miserably and they're too
stupid to move him to the pen and bring up Conroy or somebody, Fossas
continues to pitch dismally but they keep giving him innings becasue he's a
lefty, and Russell explodes they could be pretty bad.

the FAN at night wherever I go (the signal used to be WNBC, when they
played golden oldies) because you can't avoid it.  Of those three,
WIP has the best hosts hands down.  Chuck Cooperstein isn't a homer,

"The mission to revive hockey at UMass is now underway. At the  4 PM Saturday
afternoon press conference held at the new Mullins Center Arena - former
Boston College Asst. Coach Joe Mallen was awarded the 4 year, $85,000/year
contract as Head Coach for the UMass Minutemen. 

Mallen was the third viable pick for the position, right behind Jeff Jackson
(Lake Superior) and second behind Shawn Walsh (UMaine). Previous offers for 
the position were rumored to have been offered to the asst. coaches of
Brown, RPI and the head coach of the AHL Springfield Indians.

UMass hockey was disbanded in 1979 due to financial constraints that had
undermined the team's position over a period of years. In late November
of last year, the $52 million Mullins Sports Center was opened following
its one year construction deadline. 

The Minutemen are slated to play an independent Div II/Div III schedule this
upcoming winter before officially entering Hockey East for the Winter 1994
season. Mallen has yet to comment on player recruitment strategies or
potential team candidates for the Minutemen - it is expected that he will
leverage off his inside contacts within New England, the Bay State and
Europe to draw on competitive, top ice players for the University.

UMass has slated 18 hockey scholarships for the upcoming Fall semester ; 
expect to hear more from me as I hear more from my sources.

"Well, after suffering from an intense fit of Minnesota-induced cabin fever,
I've decided to road trip to Milwaukee and take in a couple of games this
weekend. A couple games at County stadium will be great to relieve tension, 
but I thought ""Why not go to Wrigley for a game too?""  

  I see the Cubs are playing the Phillies on Sat (2:05 start, I believe
that's Eastern time listed). I figured it would be fun to bounce down to
Wrigley for the day game and live it up a little. I'm wondering if anyone
(esp. Cubbie fans) have some advice on: 

  1) If I'm taking 41 (Skokie Hwy) south until it runs into 94, what's the 
     best way to get to Wrigley? I'm planning on getting there an hour or  
     two early and paying through the nose for parking to keep things easy. 

  2) Is it probable that I'll be able to walk up and get bleacher seats (2 or
     3) on game day? I figure since it's early in the year, Ryno's out and 
     the weather isn't great I should be able to get tickets. If not, what's 
     the best way to get advance tickets; can I call the Cubs' ticket office
     directly and pick up tickets at the will call window?  

  3) Any advice on where to eat before or after the game? 

  4) Do they allow inflatable I-luv-ewe dolls (present from Lundy) into the 
     bleachers? :-)

intentionally hurt someone (which bites!).


I thought they had instituted all kinds of new rules this season to stop crap 
like that?!?  Is it just me, or does the officiating just still stink to high
heaven?  IMHO, if they could get rid of the existing refs, and institute a new
system with more than one ref on the ice to keep an eye on the trouble-makers
then a lot of these things would stop, and then the game would be ruled by the
finnesse players:  Mario, Selanne, Bure, Messier, et.al...

""It's not our choice"", James Blosser, a lawyer and Huizenga Aid said
about ruling out the arena as a long term option.  ""The NHL told us we 
can't stay there.  It's not economically feasible.""

One reason is because the Miami Heat basketball team controls skybox
and advertising revenue at the arena, reducing the hockey team's profit
potential.

The hockey team is attracting arena site proposals from Broward, Dade,

A leading site is vacant land near Joe Robbie Stadium, where residents

I am trying to think how to respond to this without involving personal feeling
or perceptions and I can not without having stats to back up my points.
However, I think you approached this the wrong way. I believe all of the
people mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than Dave Kingman does. I
feel they were all much better players. I am not saying I fell they deserve to
go but that they would deserve it more. 

IMHO 
Dave Kingman - definately not. They guy only had a couple of years were he
could hit with atleast a respectable averag. The rest of his career I do not
think he was very feared by pitchers. I also do not think he did a lot for the
game. I mean really I am a Met fan - he was a Met for part of his career and I
still would not back him for the Hall of Fame.

Dave Winfield - I think so. He is feared by pitchers, he has had several
season where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are
(in my opinion - without stats) better than Kingman's (probably by quite a
bit). I also perceive him to be a leader, maybe not as much as some other
people but none the less a leader. I think he has made substantial
contributions to the game of baseball and to society. Examples of this are
some of the charitable things he has done (I know some of this from when he
was with the Yankees). I think he the type of player that kids can look up to
and while this is definately not the only criteria for the Hall of Fame I
think it deserves some consideration.

Lee Smith - Maybe, I would have to see his stats again but he definately would
deserve to go before the likes of Kingman.

Darrell Evans - No.

Eddie Murray - Maybe, He has had a very good career, he is a leader (although
a silent one), he is a good role model. Are the stats good enough? I am not
sure - but I would once again believe they are much better than Kingman's both
the average as well as the power numbers (but not as good as Winfield's). Just
think, Eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years.

Jeff Reardon - My guess is no, but it kind of depends on his numbers. Off the
top of my head I would take Lee Smith first.


Well, I strongly disagree here. Both of these guys deserve it for sure. I
talked about leadership above, both of these guys are leaders and have been
instumental in leading their teams to the post season. Robin does have very
good offensive numbers both average and power and Ozzie has okay numbers
offensively. The difference with Ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for
every run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop - he would have
shattered Aaron's home run mark by now. How many of those great plays saved
games? How many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a
game? While I believe both of these guys have numbers, baseball is about more
than numbers (or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers).
Both of these guys are proven stars and belong in the Hall of Fame. As does
George Brett who also belongs in this class of player.


Steve Garvey - I am not sure, probably not but I guess I could see someone
making a case for him. 

Jack Morris - Once again not my first choice but I can see why someone might
bring up his name.

Kirby Puckett - Probably. The only reason I do not say definately is he still
has time left in his career. If he continues doing what he has been then my
probably will turn into a definately.

Nolan Ryan - Is there really any doubt? I think I heard something about him
having some 53 records (maybe they were not all good - I don't know I did not
hear any of them just the number). He has the numbers, he has the
contributions to the game and community and he is a great role model. I would
not say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game (probably not even
top 20) but he would be the first pitcher I would put in the Hall of Fame
because of his accomplishments (no-hitters, strikeouts, respectable numbers -
even with some weaker teams) you can go on and on. I really hope he gets ALL
the possible votes.

So in summing up I have 3 groups, those that belong, those that probably do
but I am not sure and those that I lean towards saying don't belong at least
not without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go.

Yes -  Winfield, Yount, Brett(not in your mail), O. Smith, Puckett and Ryan
Maybe - Murray and L. Smith
No - Reardon, Garvey, Morris, Evans and definately Kingman

As I said I do not have the stats around so I do not have numbers to back this
up - these are entirely my opinions based on my perceptions.",sports
"










Nice try Deepak, but ""tough Whaler squad"" should have clued you in to the
fact that my Leaf woofing was tongue-in-cheek.

If playoff hockey is any more intense than the regular season variety then
it is because the teams are facing each other at least 4 consecutive times
in 7 days and hockey being the contact sport that it is, some things will
be carried over that might dissipate during the regular season.  But that is
only for some of the players.  Many of the rest, who have been playing with
injuries, who miss their families, or who, like Grant Fuhr, would really
rather be playing golf, don't really give a damn.  Of course I can't say this
for sure, but I believe that this is fairly typical of human nature and I
don't think that hockey players are above having what I consider typically
human attitudes.  

With the recent salary escalations the key players are actually losing 
money by participating in the playoffs.  The ones who regard the playoff
""take"" as some kind of a bonanza are fringe players who are unlikely
to consistently be a force in the playoffs.  Now I know some of you are
going to come back with ""winning spirit"" and all of that crap but these
players are professionals after all.  While they may love to play the 
game that love is entirely incidental to their purpose, which is, to make
a decent living. 

Of course, the coach is a professional as well, and part of what he is 
being paid to do is motivate the players.  So, if the coach does his
job well enough the players may respond with a winning effort.

The second season, is after all, merely an exhibition.  The true Champions
of the league are the division winners, the teams that come out on top 
after the long struggle of the season.  The Stanley cup playoffs merely
accord victory to the team that has remained healthy and ""hot"".  The 
emphasis on the playoffs, with their ""sudden death"" appeal has been promoted
by the media and the owners with profit purely in mind.  Even if Pittsburgh
loses the playoffs, we all know that they were really the best team in the
league over the year.  They proved it.

this is the home stadium, and that entails helping the home team win
in any way possible.  As soon as the ball was hit that far, his first
instinct should be to root for Darryl to catch it, not to try to catch
it himself, particularly when he is sitting that close.

I enjoy the attitude of the Wrigley fans, where they are against 
visiting team home runs so much, they actually throw them back on the

Now, this has nothing to do with whether Darryl could have caught it or
not.  Sure, he probably screwed up, but the fan should realize his

",sports
"
	Oh, yeah.  Dave Winfield--marginal player.  Guy didn't hit a lick, had
negligible power, was a crap fielder and had no staying power.  Dave Winfield,
now entering his (I believe) 20th big league season, is still a damn decent
hitter.  Admittedly, his defense has slipped a great deal, but in his prime,
he had a powerful arm and great range.  Take a look at the stats:  I don't 
know where you even BEGIN to make an argument that Winfield and Kingman are
similar players.  Kingman was a one-dimension power hitter--he couldn't field,
he ran like an anvil, hit for a low average (though, if I remember right, his
OBP wasn't THAT hideous...), and (for those who consider such things important)
was a absolute-primo-dick.  
	Eddie Murray?  Yup, only the best 1st baseman of the 80's.  I know that
MVP votes are conducted by mediots, but given that he got jobbed out of the
MVP he deserved in 1983, it seems that he wasn't overrated by the media.  
	Lee Smith?  Hmmmm... This one's actually pretty close.  He's had a s
solid, dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks 
(Wrigley, Fenway...).  I'd have to take a closer look at the stats (it's been 
a while), but it seems Lee Arthur is of HOF caliber.  
	You do make a legitimate point about the HOF credentials of relievers,
simply racking up a lot of saves doesn't mean a whole hell of a lot if you 
blow a bunch, too.  Simply because Minnesota and Boston and (for a month)
Atlanta used Reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one, 
the Equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves.  No way should 
HomerMan be in the HOF, IMHO.
	Darrell Evans?  Nice career, actually a bit underrated (kinda like
Ted Simmons, IMHO), but not a HOF'er.


	Lemme ask you this.  Who the hell playing the game ISN'T marginal?


	Now, wait a goddamn minute here.  Ozzie Smith absolutely REDEFINED the
position of shortstop.  His defense was SO good that he's won something along
the lines of 10 Gold Gloves.  Again, Gold Gloves are mediot-biased, and a 
good argument could be made that Larkin deserved one or two of Ozzie's more
recent awards, but usually, this is tempered by someone else in the early
80's getting the Gold Gloves Ozzie deserved earlier in his career.  Ozzie's
offense, you ask?  Good OBP, great speed numbers, in a park which, for most of his
career, depressed offense, admittedly, no power ('cept against Tom Niedenfuer
:-|), but still, a definite asset offensively.
	Yount?  3,000 hits, MVP at two different positions, uh-huh, a real
stiff.  His '82 was one of the great years EVER by a player in recent memory,
and probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of Wagner and Banks, as far as
SS numbers go.  He's a clear HOF'er, IMHO.


	Well, as far as Garvey goes, you're right.  Garvey is a ""mediot"" 
candidate, pushed because of his ""winning attitude"" (a minor factor, if one
at all), and his ""great defense"" (no errors, admittedly, but the range of
a tree stump...).  Garvey shouldn't be in the HOF.
	SkyJack?  I've said a lot of nasty things about SkyJack in the last
year or so, but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk
about Morris' ""ability to win"" which is nothing more than Morris' ""ability
to pitch when Toronto to score tons of runs"".  At this point, Morris is an
average pitcher (although from his early returns in '93, he may be damned 
close to done.).  But, in all fairness, Morris was a dominant pitcher in the
80's for up-and-down Tiger teams.  While 1984 was (obviously) a great year
for Detroit, the rest of the decade, the team was generally in contention, but
not favorites.  Morris' career numbers are quite good, and worthy of HOF
""consideration"".  
	Ryan?  Of course, but be careful.  I guarantee you that someone will
throw back your earlier logic about ""Yount and Smith being shortstops who 
hung around a long time"".  After all, Nolan never won a Cy...  Damn, he's 
just pitcher who hung around for 99 years...  His W-L record is mediocre...
(Of course, Nolan's a HOF'er...)
	Puck?  Probably, although he's got to play reasonably well for a few
more years (10 years, even good ones, aren't enough to make the HOF, most
likely).  That said, I believe Puckett WILL make the HOF, pretty much
regardless of how the rest of his career turns out (barring something REALLY 
tragic or sudden).  He's very popular in the media and with fans, and
legitimately has been one of the best CF's in the game since he joined the
league.  I've always liked the guy, and I hope he does make it.  And, in the
end, I think the Puck will make it in.  But, really, it's too early to sell.

	This debate comes up rather frequently on the net, and, believe it 
or not, I never tire of it.  It's an interesting subject.  Here's an off
the top of my head list of potential HOF'ers from each team.  I probably
left a couple of guys off, so feel free to follow up.  I won't consider ANYONE
who started playing after about 1985 (again, too early to tell.) [Note: these
are all active players, I'm not counting recent retirees]

Baltimore:  Cal Ripken (should be a lock by now, even if Gehrig's record stands)
Boston: Roger Clemens (might be a lock already, which is amazing), Dawson (?)
Detroit: Alan Trammell and Lou Whitaker (possibilities)
Milwaukee: Robin Yount (discussed earlier)
New York: Wade Boggs (possibly), Mattingly (long shot)
Toronto: Paul Molitor and Jack Morris (possibilities)

Kansas City: George Brett (lock)
Minnesota: Kirby (too early to tell), Winfield (lock)
Oakland: Eckersley (lock), McGwire (too early), Rickey (lock), Welch (LONG shot)
Texas: The Mighty Nolan [Too early to consider Canseco or Strange :-)]

Cubs: Sandberg (lock)
St. Louis: Ozzie (lock), Lee Smith (probably)
New York: Murray (almost a lock), Saberhagen (obviously, he's got to regain
				  	      past form)
[And most certainly, NOT Vince Coleman, despite what he'll tell you :-)]

Los Angeles: Butler, Strawberry, and Hershiser are all long shots.
San Diego: Tony Gwynn (pretty good shot)
Colorado: Dale Murphy (a good shot), Ryan Bowen (just to see if you're awake)

	[Before I get flames: this is an off-the-top-of-the-head list, there's
probably a few deserving candidates that I left off, and, I didn't include
Barry Bonds, Will Clark, Any Atlanta Starting Pitcher, Frank Thomas, Canseco,
McGriff, etc. because I only considered guys who started playing before
1985)]

I am not at all clear about what you are trying to say here.   If  you
asked  somone,  who  had never heard of hockey before, if LA played in
the Smythe division what do you think  that  the  response  would  be?
What  if you asked this person if LA played in the West division?  The
naming of  divisions  after  long-dead  entrepreneurs  is  unnecessary
obfuscation.



Hardly.  The ""established"" situation existed prior to Smythe,  et  al.
The  Stanley  Cup was a challenge trophy up for grabs to whatever team
could successfully mount the challenge.  What our  dear  founders  did
was formalize the challenge.  They created a closed league, an oligop-
olistic professional system, in the interests of making money.  Wheth-
er  or  not  that system has contributed to better hockey is certainly
debatable.  We are, however, stuck with their invention and  that  de-
bate  is  academic.   The  point  to  be made, however, is that people
played hockey and people enjoyed watching hockey  long  before  Smythe
and his pals showed up.


What's wrong with best defenceman, period?  Was there  ever  a  better
defenceman?   Was  there  ever a better player?  And if you think that
Bruce Norris' contribution was somehow  more  significant  than  Bobby
Orr's  then,  in the interests of education, why don't you take a poll
and find out how many people know who Norris was?  But you don't  have
to, do you?


So you don't feel that you should have to make the effort to  remember
that  Vancouver  plays in the West division?  (Or Pacific, or whatever
other intuitively understandable moniker is chosen.)



And of course you neatly deleted Jason's  jingoistic  rant  about  the
game  losing  its  ""Canadianization"".   Quoting me out of context does
more to erode your credibility than it  does  mine.   My  position  is
clearly  progressive  and  is anything but ""biased, closed minded, ig-
norant"".  Arrogant, I will grant you.


Nice try John.  But for a flame to be truly effective you have to
display  at  least  enough  intelligence  to  earn  your target's
respect.

  That brings up an interesting point. Anyone else catch ESPN's piece about
prospects and the relationship between age, career length, MVPs and Hall of
Fame members? It was part of their preseason special. Basically, they looked 
at players that had amassed 1000 plate appearances (or ABs) by the time they
were 24, and noticed some interesting things. 

  For starters, they found out such players comprised the majority of MVPs in
the history of the game. They also found out such players represented the
majority of the players in the hall of fame. The kicker, though, was that
they actually did some number-crunching and found that such players' careers
lasted much longer than the careers of players not in that group. They also  
found that these players produced at both a greater level of performance and
produced over twice the raw totals (HRs, etc) of the other players. The first
group outhit the second something like .282 to .260 in raw BA, and blew away
the second group in such categories as HRs, 2Bs, RBIs, etc. 

  It was the most impressive thing I've seen on ESPN in recent memory. 

  I guess Ray Knight makes his rebuttal tonight.

	I think that you are incorrect, Roger.  Patrick,
Smythe and Adams all played or coached in the league before becoming
front office types.  Hence, they did help build the league, although
they were not great players themselves.  

	I agree that a name is a name is a name, and if some people
have trouble with names that are not easily processed by the fans,
then changing them to names that are more easily processed seems like
a reasonable idea.  If we can get people in the (arena) door by being
uncomplicated, then let's do so.  Once we have them, they will realize
what a great game hockey is, and we can then teach them something
abotu the history of the game.  
 

	No, I would not want to see a Ballard division.  But to say
that these owners are assholes, hence all NHL management people are
assholes would be fallacious.  Conn Smythe, for example, was a classy
individual (from what I have heard). 

	Also, isn't the point of ""professional"" hockey to make money
for all those involved, which would include the players.  What I think
you might be saying is that the players have not made as much money as
should have been their due, and it is the players that are what make
the game great not the people who put them on the ice, so naming
division after management people rather than players is adding insult
(in the form of lesser recognition) to injury (less money than was
deserved).   ",sports

"So far Simmons looks like a total idiot.


1) Zane Smith should learn how to ""switchpitch"" and return from the DL. I
would rather have Zane Smith pitch right handed than have Moeller pitch at all.

2) I am sure Simmons was ready to say I told you so after Otto had an
impressive win last week. NOw Otto's latest debacle has restored Simmon's
reputation. Now he looks like he is back in his '92 form when he had the
AL's highest ERA among starters. Four our sake(not Ted's sake), I hope he
pitches with a 3.5 ERA for the rest of the season. Yeah, right.

3) Tomlin and Merced are a bit disappointing. They are still doing decently.
BUt considering the considerable amount of talent and maturity they have
shown their first seasons, they seem to have actually gotten a little
bit worse. Tomlin was almost unhittable his rookie year against lefty batters.
Merced had a very good OBA his rookie year. He showed a lot of concentration at
the plate in his rookie year.

4) Walk: Well, he seems to be on the losing end tonight. BUt I still think that
Walk desrved his contract.

5) Leyland should accept a part of the blame for the LaValliere situation. I
can't understand his and management's fear of losing Tom Prince through
waivers. Even if they do, what's the use. He is aright hander like Slaught.
Not a very smart platoon. Also, I am blaming Leyland in this case, since he is hcurrently    convinced that LaVAlliere is through, while giving him
way too much time last year in the regular season AND the playoffs(SLaught
should have played in all 7 games; he has a good average against right handed
pitching). Didn't Leyland and Simmons forsee this last year, and attempt to
trade LaValliere last year itself? Any fool could tell them LaVAlliere
wasn't very fit last year.

6) Dennis MOeller is SCARY!!!
7) Candeleria: Well, he is not going to have such a high ERA at the end of the
season. Maybe it will be in 3-4 range. BUt $1 million  plus? Come on. Other
than the customary home run giving stage Patterson goes through for a few weeks,
Patterson has served the PIrates very well each year. So far, he seems to have
pitched well for the Rangers. I think the PIrates should have spent the money
on Patterson in stead.

8) The Rookie batters: Well, Young has surprised me a bit with his instant impact. Other than that, their excellent performance hasn't been too much of a surprise. I think we should thank Doughty for that.

9) Rookie Pitchers: Worse than expected, especially Cooke.
10) Slaught: How come he wasn't given a contract extension last year? NOw his
value has increased immensely.

11) Lonnie Smith!! Well, Eric Davis was signed for a comparable amount.
Let's see. Eric can hit better. He can run better. He can field better.
Now why didnt the PIrates go after Eric Davis. An injured Davis is better
than a healthy Lonnie Smith. Even if Lonnnie Smith gets some big hits this year,he won't be an asset. He has looked terrible on the bases and in the field.

12) Management: BIG BIG ZERO. Sauer has yet to make a forceful agreement
in favor of revenue sharing. He seems more concerned about pleasing that
idiot Danforth by preparing the team for a move to Tampa Bay.
13) Alex Cole fiasco. The PIrates infield and CF positions look good. The
RF and LF would have looked good if we could have gotten Cole to replace
two of the four outfielders. Eric Davis, Van Slyke and Cole would have made a
very respectable outfield. Even without Eric Davis, thye PIrates would have
a respectable outfield with Cole, SVan Slyke, and Merced(I think he should hit
left handed against lefts in stead of switch hitting). Simmons did have options
for the outfield. Ironically, the biggest accomplishment of Simmon's tenure was
getting Alex Cole really cheap. Too bad.

14) Compensatory draft picks for Bonds: Forget it. The pirates can rant and rave.
they will not get those picks. As of now, the issue is still being appealed.
Now, if this doesnt convince anyone that Simmons and Sauer are idiots,
nothing else will.

On a final note. Tim Wakefield won't be as awful as he was in his last 2
starts. BUt don't count on him pitching like last year for the rest of
the season. Also, if the Pirates are in contention towards rthe end of the
season, they will miss Redus's clutch hitting and his speed(he has peaked
in the second half of the last 2 seasons)>

"To all those out there wondering about who holds the record for three
homer games ina career, the answer is Johnny Mize in his career with the 
Cards and the Yanks.  He hit three 6 times.  I am almost sure about this. In
case anyone is wondering, the record for two homer games is held by Babe
Ruth and is 72.  Mize's record may not last for much longer because of Juan
Gonzalez.  He has at least three games with three and maybe 4.  I know that 
he had at least two last year and one as a rookie.  I don't have any record
books at college for me to check on though.  Please let me know, okay, if I 
am wrong.  
	Onto the Padres.  Is there anyone out there who follows them?- especial-ly those with access to local news?  I don't here anything in Los Angeles and I
can't get McPaper consistently around here.  
comment:  It looks as though San Diego has gotten the better of the two deals
that brought Bell and Plantier to the Padres.  It has also forced the team to use Darrell Shermann.  Of course, Plantier could get injured again or he could 
hit with the power of 91 but with a lower average.  Bell always could finish
with .240 and 15-18 hrs-essentially Jerald Clark's numbers.  
leadoff comment:  Craig Shipley??????  I get on base 29% of the time if I'm 
lucky at leadoff?  Hell, of the usual starters, use Gwynn.  He's got 4 steals
already.  Is Shipley starting because of an injury to Stillwell, though?  I
haven't seen Stillwell's name in any box scores.  Anyway unless you are going
to use Shermann at leadoff then use Gwynn.  He at lesat gets on base and this
year is stealing bases.
Sheffield comment:  Though the season is early and stats mean nothing.
Witness Phillips batting .500+ currently.  But does Sheffield have an injury,
or anythingelse wrong with him.  I just don't hear anything.
Andy Benes:  Is he pitching like he did in the second half of '91?   or is 
this a flash of promise that he throws out evrey now and then?   Has anyone 
seen him pitch the two good games?
score for today, Sunday april 18:  Padres 10, St Louis 6.  Padres sweep the
Cardinals as Gwynn goes 5 for 5 with a homer.  Sheffield and Tueful also homer
in a winning cause.

As far as I know Dusseldorf has only one Canadian-German forward (i.e. a  player
who was born in Canada but now has a German passport). 
Benoit Doucet became german by marriing a german and he is going to play 
for Germany in the WC.

The other Canada-born forwards are:
	Peter-John Lee (has British passport)
	Chris Valentine
	Dale Dercatch
	Steve Gootas
 	Earl Spry (?)

At the moment there are only three German-born forwards coming into my mind:
	Bernd Trunschka, Andreas Brockmann, Ernst Koepf

Yes, but as has been mentioned many times before, the Islanders play at
the talent level of their opponent.  Since Hartford is pitiful, the
Islanders played pitiful.  Since Pittsburgh is great, the Isles will most
likely play great.  This is most likely due to inexperience and very poor
shooting.  To Greg: yes, I have noticed that the Islanders couldn't hit
the broad side of a barn with the puck if they were two feet in front of
it.  Does anyone have shooting percentages?  I don't know if that would
help, since they often miss the net completely, but it might shed some
light on the subject.

I happen to be a big fan of Jayson Stark.  He is a baseball writer for the 
Philadelphia Inquirer.  Every tuesday he writes a ""Week in Review"" column.  
He writes about unusual situations that occured during the week.  Unusual
stats.  He has a section called ""Kinerisms of the Week"" which are stupid
lines by Mets brodcaster Ralph Kiner.  Every year he has the LGTGAH contest.
That stands for ""Last guy to get a hit.""  He also writes for Baseball 
America.  That column is sort of a highlights of ""Week in Review.""  If you 
can, check his column out sometime.  He might make you laugh.

Yankess (to the tune of ""Subterranean Homesick Blues"")

Howe is in the basement, mixing up the medicine.
George is on the pavement thinking 'bout the government.
Wade Boggs in a trench coat, bat out, paid off,
Says he's got a bad back, wants to get it laid off.
Look out kids, it's somethin' you did.
Don't know when, but it's Columbus again.

Mets (to the tune of ""Like a Rolling Stone"")

Once upon a time you played so fine
you threw away Dykstra before his prime, didn't you?
People said ""Beware Cone, he's bound to roam""
But you thought they were just kidding you.
You used to laugh about, 
The Strawberry that was headin' out.
But now you don't talk so loud,
Now you don't seem so proud,
About having to shop Vince Coleman for your next deal....

Phillies (to the tune of ""Highway 61"")

Well Daulton and Dykstra should have some fun,
Just keep them off of Highway 61!

Giants (to the tune of ""The Ballad of Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter"")

This is the story of the Magowan,
The man St. Petersburg came to pan,
For something that he never done,
He sits in the owner's box but one...
Day he could have been the Tampian of the world!

Not particularly *in* the World Series. During the season, he was probably
more valuable than, say, putting Olerud out there to pitch, but yeah, he
*was* valuable in getting them there. In the postseason, he sucked dirty
canal water through a straw. The Jays won *in spite* of Morris much more
than *because of* him.


Umm, Roger? Return with us to those halcyon days of a few postings ago,
where the poster Valentine was replying to used # of WS rings as a measure
of better. The concept is called ""context"", and you should really become
familiar with it someday.


Unless this transaltes to ""Clemens hasn't gone into Lou Gorman's office with
a large caliber handgun and refused to come out until he'd been traded to
the Jays,"" I'm at a complete loss as to any possible meaning for it.


What on earth does this mean? Over their careers, Clemens has ""won"" 68% of
the games he's started, Morris 58%. Per year, Clemens has averaged nearly 17
wins, Morris just under 15. Would you grant the proposition that preventing
the other team from scoring increases your chances of winning  a game? If
so, then consider that Clemens allows 2.8 runs/9 innings pitched. Morris
allows nearly a run more per nine innings. In fact, Jack Morris has never in
his career had an ERA for a single year as good as Clemens' career ERA. But
I forget, in the Maynardverse there was obviously some mystical significance
to Buckner missing that grounder in 1986; had Morris been on the Sox, it
would have been a routine groundout, right?


Speaking of stupid, it has been patiently (and not-so-patiently) explained to
you many times that attributing greatness to players based on the
accomplishments of their teams makes about as much sense as claiming that
a racecar has the most attractive paint job because it won the race. Your
continued failure to not only understand but even to intelligently reply to
any of the arguments presented leads me to the conclusion that you must have
spent a few too many games in goal without a mask.


No one is crying; the Jays won, and as a team they certainly deserved to win
at least the AL East. They performed well in two short series and won the
World Series, and I congratulate them for it. As a Red Sox fan, I hope they
keep Morris. I was happy when they picked up Stewart, and elated when they
traded for Darrin Jackson. You see, unless you believe in some mystical link
between Morris and the offense, you can hardly help but believe that the man
was credited with so many wins last year because he got lucky. Luck runs
out, just like it did in 1982 when he pitched 50-odd more innings than 1992,
gave up exactly *one* earned run more than in 1992, and went 17-16.

Seriously, Roger, I'd really like to hear your explanation of the difference
between the 1982 Morris and the 1992 Morris. Which one was a better pitcher,
and why? Did Morris somehow ""learn how to win"" in the intervening ten years?
If so, then why did he go 18-12 in 1991 with Minnesota with an ERA over half
a run lower than 1992?

Not Responsible -- Dain Bramaged!!",sports
"Is there any doubt that this is true?  After a few down years, the A.L. East
is back to where it was in the early eighties.  With the emergence of the O's
and the Yanks, it is far and away the best.  While the N.L. West has the best
team in baseball, and the Reds aren't bad either, they have nothing else.  The
Giants, Astros, and Padres all have talent, they do not have the all arounf
teams that are found in the A.L. East.  And the Dodgers just plain suck.  As
for the Rockies, who knows?
   The A.L. East has the defending champs, and although they lost a lot to
free agency, Toronto is still one of the best in baseball.  The Orioles have
the preseason favorite to win the Cy Young in Mike Mussina, and you can never
forget about Ripken.  The signings of Harold Baines and Harold Reynolds don't
hurt to much either, although I always liked Bill Ripken.  While they let a
lot go this summer (Randy Milligan, Joe Orsulak, Bill Ripken, Bob Milacki, Sam
Horn, Storm Davis, and Craig Lefferts), they kept the heart of their team
intact.

My predicted finish:
1. Baltimore (Could be a biased opinion)
2. NY Yankees
3. Toronto
4. Milwaukee
5. Detroit
6. Boston
7. Cleveland (Would have been higher if not for the accident)

Go O's!!!!!!!!",sports
"Having run completely out of time, I've got to get my prophesies and
predictions for the A.L. out.  Qualifications -- one of the worse
finishes in last year's prediction contest.

AL East -- 1993

1.  Baltimore Orioles
Why the Orioles?  Well, I pondered long and hard, and it all came down to
this:
  -- The Blue Jays are going the wrong direction.
  -- Can't bring myself to pick the Yankees
  -- Milwaukee was a fluke
  -- Indians aren't ready to contend
  -- Red Sox were bad last year, and didn't get any better
  -- Detroit's pitching will be the new definition of ""replacement level""
""But you don't really think the Orioles will win, do you.""  No.  As a matter
of fact, I can't see any team in the American League winning either division
on paper (with the possible exception of the Yankees, who I hate).  But some-
body has to win, so I pick the Orioles.  ""You don't really think that Brady
Anderson is going to repeat, do you?""  No.  I'm basing the Orioles prediction
on the expectation of big years from Cal Ripken and Glenn Davis.  ""Glenn
Davis?  That's insane"".  Yes.  So, without further ado:
STRONG POINTS:  Hoiles, Ripken some years, Olson, getting rid of Billy Ripken.
WEAK POINTS:  Segui may start.  Valenzuela (the original 30-something) may be
  the fifth starter.  Oates puts his best hitters at the bottom of the lineup.
  (Does anybody else think that might be a calculated maneuver to minimize
  the effect of a slumping Ripken?  If you can't move Ripken out of the #3
  spot, why not move the rest of the line up?)
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Glenn Davis wins comeback player of the year.
WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  In a tight pennant race, team trades for Pecota.
ObPrediction:  ""The Streak"" continues.  Harold Reynolds leads the team in
  caught stealing.

2. New York Yankees.
STRONG POINTS:  Abbot, Key, Perez.  Could have best pitching in American
  League.  Boggs should improve on Hayes.
WEAK POINTS:  Mattingly still considered best hitter.  The Steinbrenner 
  factor.  (The Yankees lost to the Mets.  Can wholesale changes be far
  behind?)  Never count on rookie pitchers (i.e. Wickman & Millitello) to
  win a division.
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Boggs hits over .300
WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Howe gets arrested again.
ObPrediction:  Mattingly won't top a 700 OPS.

3.  Toronto Blue Jays
STRONG POINTS:  Management willing to make big deals.  Management has eerie
  power to convince other teams its prospects are not suspects.  Olerud.
  Guzman.  Alomar.
WEAK POINTS:  The Jackson for Bell trade has shaken my faith in Gillick.
  Losing Stewart may hurt rotation (that's *really* a bad sign).  No one in
  the outfield can get on base.  Pitching is thin behind Guzman and Ward.
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Jack Morris considered Cy Young contender in August
WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Club makes no major deals in August.
ObPrediction:  Morris will post better ERA and WHIP totals than last year.  And
  have a losing record.

4.  Milwaukee Brewers
STRONG POINTS:  Pitching staff was exceptional -- last year.
WEAK POINTS:  Molitor gone.  Surhoff at third?  Why?  Eldred can't keep it up.
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Listach and Eldred play like last year.
WOULD BE BAD SIGN:  Bones plays like last year.
ObPrediction:  Surhoff won't finish the year at third.

5.  Cleveland Indians
STRONG POINTS:  Baerga, Belle, Nagy
WEAK POINTS:  Pitching staff thin -- losing Olin really hurts.  Starts Felix
  Fermin.
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Bielecki's ERA is consistent with his Atlanta starts.
WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Ted Power -- bullpen ace.
ObPrediction:  Alomar will be back on the DL by the all-star break.

6.  Boston Red Sox
STRONG POINTS:  Clemens, Viola, Clemens, Detroit, Clemens
WEAK POINTS:  Most incompetent GM in baseball.  Key free agent signing -- Andre
  Dawson.  Burks is gone -- Hatcher in center.
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Rainouts in between Clemens starts.
WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Clemens on the DL
ObPrediction:  Russell will make Sox fans forget Reardon.  Interpret that how
  you will :->

7.  Detroit Tigers
STRONG POINTS:  Tettleton, Phillips, Whitaker
WEAK POINTS:  If Fielder keeps declining, he'll be a shortstop this year.
  Worst rotation in baseball entirely replaced -- but not necessarily better.
  This year could be *very* ugly.
WOULD BE A GOOD SIGN:  Cecil Fielder deserving the MVP.
WOULD BE A BAD SIGN:  Cecil Fielder not whining about deserving an MVP.
ObPrediction:  Cecil *won't* lead the league in RBIs.

One more division to go....

#2	ROB ZETTLER		Season:	4th
Acquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		C/C-

Zettler gave the Sharks every bit he's got this year; unfortunately, this still
wasn't enough to make him any more than a marginal NHLer, if that.  He works
hard, for sure, but is no better than average on defense, and is prone to
costly penalties and defensive lapses at times, while being basically an
offensive zero (0 goal and 7 assists in 79 games).  He would be hardpressed
to make the team next year.

#3	DAVID WILLIAMS		Season: 2nd
Acquired:	'91-92, free agent from New Jersey
Grade:		C/C-

IMO, Williams was the most valuable defenseman for the Sharks in '91-92,
playing a combination of good offense (3 goals and 25 assists in 56 games) and
good defense.  But he, playing the first part of this season in Kansas City,
was good neither offensively nor defensively this year; it, then, appears that
'91-92 was a fluke.  Although he improved towards the end of the season, he
was prone to being out of position defensively, and did not demonstrate the
playmaking skills that made him the team's leading scorer among defensemen last
year.  He would also be hardpressed to make the team next year.

#4	JAYSON MORE		Season: 2nd
Acquired:	'91-92, from Montreal in expansion draft
Grade:		B+

After being touted as the team's top defensive prospects in training camp
before '91-92, More had a rather disappointing '91-92, as he was not
particularly good defensively, and had just 17 points in 46 games.  He, then,
proceeded to improve his game massively this season, becoming the team's most
reliable defenseman, whom the team can count on night in and night out to play
steady defense and providing occasional (but only occasional) offensive flash.
Offensively, he was even more disappointing than last year (11 points in 73
games), but his defense improved tremendously.  He is probably best as the
defensive part of a defense combination with an offensive defenseman.

#5	NEIL WILKINSON		Season: 4th
Acquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		B-

Wilkinson was probably the team's top defensive defenseman in '91-92.  However,
partially because of injuries, he was not the same this year, as he missed 25
games total due to nagging knee and back injuries, and seemed to be slowed
even when playing.  He, then, had often to be saved by his defensive partners;
that is, if they are there at all.  But he also had some solid games, and if
he can be complete healthy, he can still be a force.

#6	SANDIS OZOLINSH		Season: 1st
Acquired:	'91-92, 2nd round pick in entry draft
Grade:		I (A)

At the time of his injury (December 30, against the Philadelphia Flyers),
Ozolinsh was well on track to be, IMO, the team's MVP.  A serious knee injury
in that game, though, forced him to miss the rest of the season (47 games),
but he still finished as the team's top scorer among defensemen (23 points),
which, of course, tells more about the lack of offense the Sharks had from
their defensemen, but it also tells of Ozolinsh's abilities.  At the time, he
was playing very good defense along with excellent offense; he was still
susceptible to so-called ""rookie mistakes,"" but was probably the defenseman who
made the least of them on the team, rookie or veteran.  If he can come back
from his injuries, he is ready to be a star.

#19	DOUG ZMOLEK		Season: 1st
Acquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		B

Zmolek had basically a solid and durable year, being one of the only two Sharks
to play in all 84 games of the season.  He was solid on defense, but
after being billed as an offensive defenseman, he didn't show it (15 points).
He was also prone to penalties, and his 229 penalty minutes was second on the
team; however, that was also an indication that he was fearly when facing tough
physical opponents, and he was at his best when playing physically.  But to
become a fixture in this league, he needs to improve both offensively and
defensively, and cut down on the number of power-plays he gives to opponents.",sports

	The runner can leave his base at any time.  If the ball is caught,
he's got to tag up.  If it isn't caught, he _doesn't_ have to tag up at
all.  So, if he's feeling lucky, your runner at second can sprint for glory
as soon as the ball is popped up.  If it isn't caught, he's probably scored
a run.  If it is, he's probably headed for AAA.  

	The only effect the infield fly has is to make the batter out,
thereby removing the force on the runners on base.  All other rules apply,
as if you were standing second with first open and the ball is popped up.

Foolish me.  And here I thought it had something to do with the

lineup, who also suddenly came alive those two games.

but then he starts to go insane. A sure sign that he's losing his stuff

The other day he called Sosa's homerun against the Sox and
claimed the game would be going into extra innings when the
score was 8-3 in the 5th.

So yesterday he notices that Sosa's ahead in the count against
Maddux and says, ""This is a fastball situation and Sosa will be
looking for it.  But this is also the spot where Maddux throws
the straight change.""   Sure enough. Sosa gets ahead on it and pops
it up to the infield.

Lloyd Pettit.


Yes, it is true that he refused to buy a franchise from the NHL for $50M; but
at the time the reason was that the established market for teams was much 
less than that. He felt that no one would pay $50M for an expansion team, and
that he would simply wait to buy an existing franchise for less than that. But
the market fooled him, and 5 teams have been created for $50M apiece in the
last three years, and even the existing teams can't be moved for less than 
$50M and I doubt that he could get one for that little.

Pettit gambled and lost. Now he'll have to pay more.",sports

Funny you should mention it...this is exactly the case I was going to make.


I will grant that a star like Mario will draw fans, even if the team sucks. 
But this is short term only; I still do not think the attendance increase 
will last, unless the team is a winning/competitive/improving/butt-kicking
one.  Pittsburgh was still getting better, so people continued to support
them.  If they suddenly dropped to, say, 50 points, you'd have knee surgery
for some of the people jumping off the bandwagon.  


Ok.  My numbers came from the NHL Guide and Record Book. 


You can give the credit to Mario since he deserves it.  But my point is that
it wasn't Mario himself, but it was the *expectation* of things to come (i.e.
a winning team) that he created by being the next great hockey superstar. And
before anybody jumps in and says I'm nit-picking and mincing words, go back
and read from where this thread started...

It might help to think about what would go through a fan's mind who suddenly
found an interest in Mario and the Pens.  Was it ""gee, Mario Lemieux is
amazing, I'll go watch him play"", or was it ""gee, now we've got a *kick*
*ass* guy on *our* side, I'll go watch him play"".  I think it was the latter.


I don't think this is accurate.  The *tickets* sell, but people don't go to
the games.  I think this thread has already been discussed...season ticket
holders in LA don't always use their tickets.  So in effect, after the Kings
initial success following Gretzky's arrival (68 to 91 points, same source)
and corresponding attendance jump, there has been an effective drop in
attendance even though ticket sales may not have changed much.  

Whether or not the Kings are a 'winner' is debatable.  I claim that since
Gretzky's arrival they have at the very least been competitive...I also claim
that McNall has made a stupid move in trying to reassemble the Oiler
dynasty...but that's another story and included only because I don't like
McNall:-).  Anyway,  McNall did do some heavy marketing around Gretzky, and
that undoubtedly was also responsible for the attendance and merchandising
sales, etc.  But as I said, when the Kings have been in there little
tailspins over the past couple of years there have been empty seats at the
Forum even if the tickets were sold.


For the short term, IMO.  Although I think that it's inevitable that the team
will improve with a player such as Lemieux or Gretzky, simply because they
make people around them better.


Well, at least we are in full agreement here!


So are you saying Roger has ever had a valid point? <couldn't resist...>


Yes, but they are doing no worse than last year.  I think the same type of
reasoning I applied to a new Pittsburgh fan applies to all the extra people
showing up at Winnipeg games.  It's difficult to predict, but do you think
that if the Jets miss the playoffs next season that in the year after they
will maintain their attendance levels?  I seriously doubt it, because in that
case the expectation of an improving team would be gone, with or without
Selanne.",sports
"Well, it's not that bad. But I am still pretty pissed of at the
local ABC coverage. They cut off the first half hour of coverage by playing
David Brinkley at 12:30 instead of an earlier time slot. I don't

not watch the game why would they decide to show most of the game? And
if they showed the remaining 2.5 hours of the game, would it hurt to play
David Brinkley at its regular time? They dont have any decent programming
before noon anyway. I called the sports dept and blasted them on their

But ultimately their hockey philosophies are like night and day...
Keenan believes in pressuring the opposition and taking the

"One last infield fly question that has always puzzled me and hasn't

If Infield Fly is declared and the ball is caught, runners can tag up

However, if the Infield Fly is *not* caught, at what point can a
runner legally leave his base w/o fear of being doubled off for
advancing too early?  When the
ball hits the ground?  When a fielder first touches the ball after it
hits the ground?

"Well, Maddux looked excellent as the Braves shutout the Cubs 1 - 0.
Justice drove in the only run with an RBI single in the first. Get
ready for him to have a monster year. He is now hitting the ball to
the opposite field with a lot of power to go with his natural 
power to right field and his good batting eye. If he stays healthy
which he should (his back is full strength this year) he should
get over 100 RBI and close to 30 HR.

In another note, the Marlins got off to a good start beating the
Dodgers. I believe the score was 6 - 3 but I'm not sure. I wish
them and the Rockies well this year. Hell. I think it would be
funny to watch the Dodgers hit the cellar again this year.",sports

"The Blues scored two power-play goals in 17 seconds in the third period
and the beat the Chicago Blackhawks 4-3 Sunday afternoon at Chicago Stadium.
Brendan Shanahan tied the game 3-3 and Brett Hull scored the game winner 17
seconds later. Jeff Brown and Denny Felsner scored the other Blues goals.
Brian Noonan had the hat trick for the Hawks, who also had some very good
goaltending from Ed Belfour. Blues goalie Curtis Joseph was solid down the
stretch to preserve the Blues lead.

The Hawks came out strong in the first period, outshooting the Blues 6-1 and
taking a 1-0 lead on Noonan's first goal. Right after an interference penalty
on Rick Zombo had expired, Keith Brown intercepted a clearing attempt at the
blue line and passed the puck to Steve Larmer in the right circle. Larmer fired
a long slap shot, and Noonan deflected the puck between Joseph's pads. After
the goal, the Blues picked up the intensity and went on to outshoot the Hawks
10-9 in the first period.

Jeff Brown tied the game 1-1 at 3:12 of the second. Nelson Emerson broke in on
the left side, got by Craig Muni and pushed the puck across the slot. Belfour
came out to play the pass and shoveled it to the right boards, where Brown
collected it and slapped it in before Belfour could get back to the goal.

Two minutes later on a Hawks power play, Belfour stopped Rich Sutter on a
short-handed break-in. Chris Chelios picked up the puck and passed it to Jeremy
Roenick who carried it on right wing and found an open Noonan with a nice pass
across the slot. Noonan fired it past Joseph at 5:30 for the 2-1 lead.

Noonan completed his hat trick 3:11 later to increase the Hawks' lead to 3-1.
Stephane Matteau made a nice pass from the right boards to Noonan who beat
Stephane Quintal by driving to the net. Joseph had no chance as Noonan
deflected the puck in the net.

Denny Felsner reduced the Blues deficit to 3-1 at 12:49 after picking up the
rebound of Basil McRae's slap shot from the slot. Janney set up McRae for
the shot, and the puck sailed wide of the net and bounced off the end boards
to Felsner. Felsner sticked the rebound into the partially open net. The Blues
outshot the Hawks 10-5 in the second period.

With the Blackhawks leading 3-2 at 9:56 of the third, Stephane Matteau picked
up a high sticking penalty. Just 53 seconds into the power play, Steve Smith
was called for slashing, giving the Blues a 5-on-3 advantage for 1:07.

The Blues didn't waste time as Brendan Shanahan scored just 23 seconds into
the two-man advantage to tie the game 3-3. Janney found Hull in the slot,
and Hull fired a rocket at Belfour. Jeff Brown collected the rebound and
passed it to Shanahan in the left circle. Shanahan beat Belfour from a sharp
angle.

Just 17 seconds later, Hull scored the game winner for the Blues. Nelson
Emerson broke in on right wing, carried the puck behind the net along with
two Hawks defensemen. Emerson made a nice pass to an unchecked Hull in the
slot, and Hull beat Belfour to put the Blues up 4-3.

The Hawks had several chances to tie the game in the final minutes, but Joseph
made some brilliant saves to prevent the Hawks from scoring. He stopped Troy
Murray point blank from just right of the crease with 2:30 left in the game.
The Blues killed off a late Hawks power play, with Rich Sutter clearing the
puck with his hand as it was trickling along the goal line. The Blues held
on to win the game. The Hawks oushot the Blues 13-7 in the third period,
totaling 27 shots on goal for each team. The Blues special teams were excellent
in the game. The Blues killed 6 of 7 Hawks power plays, and scored twice on
on four power play chances. The Blues ranked among the best special teams in
the league. They rank 2nd in penalty killing and 3rd on the power play.
 
The game was carried live on ABC, the first time an NHL game other than an
All-Star game has been shown on network television since May 24, 1980, when
CBS carried Game 6 of the Stanley Cup finals.

The best-of-seven series continues Wednesday in Chicago and Friday and Sunday
in St. Louis.

"Philadelphia at Chicago:  Teams tied for 1st after Sunday
     Dick Redding battled Chet Brewer in the first game of a dramatic four
game series.  One Friday, one Saturday, and a good-old Sunday doubleheader.
""What could be better,"" declared Ernie Banks.  Perhaps the fact that the Cubs
are challenging?
     ""It's pitching, it's always been pitching that we've lacked,"" announced
Ryne Sandberg.  ""If we can get by Brewer, then beat Carlton, Alexander, or
Bunning - preferrably 2 of the last three - we'll know we might be able to
win.
     ""Lord, I hope we pull it off.""
     The Phils scored once in the top of the first; Richie Ashburn singled, Pete
Rose followed with a hit, sending Ashburn around second.  Kiki Cuyler cut
the ball off in left center, and threw a bullet in to Ernie Banks, who threw
to Ron Santo to get Ashburn at third.  Rose went to second on the play.
     Christobel Torrienti lifted a long fly to center, moving Pete Rose to
third.  Schmidt was walked - the Cubs were absolutely refusing to let him
beat them.  Both Torrienti and Schmidt will likely draw 130-150 walks this
year.  Chuck Klein is starting to hit very well, and he lashed a double into a
gap in right-center.  ""Cool Papa"" Bell's speed allowed him to cut the ball off
and prevent Schmidt from scoring.  Nellie Fox was walked, and Bob Boone
grounded out to second, ending the threat.  
     ""Teams are starting to realize that you don't have to pitch to Schmidt or
Torrienti, and that is lowering their run total.  It puts a lot of pressure on
Klein and Dick Allen (who platoons with Chuck Klein and occasionally spells
Rose at first), and it's a credit to the Phillies that they've been able to
sustain their pace.  The picthers have slumped at times.""  So came the
analysis from Frank Chance.
     The Cubs got that run back when Bell bunted for a hit, Thomas' grounder
moved him to second, and - after Sandberg made out - Billy Williams singled
home a run.  In the sixth, Ron Santo launched a two-run homer to make it
3-1.  Dick Redding got in trouble in the eighth, as Schmidt singled and Klein
singled him to third.  Ed Reulbach entered to face Fox, but Dick Allen popped
out of the dugout to hit.  Allen doubled to right, but luckily for the Cubs,
Williams had moved to left and Andre Dawson had been inserted for defense.
He fired a bullet to home plate to keep Klein at third.  Lance Parrish, hitting
for Boone, was walked, and Bruce Sutter entered.  Larry Bowa grounded into
a 1-2-3 double play, but Ed Delahanty walked as a pinch-hitter.  Desiring a
strikeout, since Ashburn was likely to attempt a bunt hit with the quick
Trillo pinch-running at third, Chance brought in Lee Smith, who induced a
pop-up to the catcher from the speedy centerfielder, ending the inning.  The
Cubs took the win, 3-2, moving a game behind the Phillies.
     Steve Carlton was called upon to battle 3-Finger Brown Saturday.  To get
another righthander in the lineup, Ron Santo moved to first and Bill Madlock
played third.  Unfortunately, Brown allowed six doubles, and the Cub bullpen
was worn down even more, as the Cubs tried to maintain a lead against
Lefty.  Madlock, batting sixth, had knocked two doubles of his own, driving
home four runs.  Gabby Hartnett hit two home runs, and Cuyler added
another, and the score was 8-6, Cubs after six innings.  The Phillie bullpen
had more troubles in the bottom of the eighth, as the Cubs grabbed 3 more
runs to ice an 11-7 triumph.
     Sunday's twin bill saw Cool Papa Bell gather seven straight hits at one
point, including a rare outside-the-park home run in the second game, off
Robin Roberts.  Grover Alexander of the Phils took the first contest, 4-2, but
the Cubs captured the second one 5-4, with Waddell gaining the win.  Bruce
Sutter tossed two innings for the save, though he allowed one run in the
eighth.  The Cardinals stood half a game behind these co-leaders, and would
conclude their series with the Expos on Monday.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
     Montreal at St. Louis(August 3-6): 3-way tie for 1st
     Dennis Martinez is on a roll, and he continued it versus John Tudor Friday.
The Expos have a wide variety of hitters, and - while they aren't among the
all-time greats, they are getting the job done.  After winning their first
first two games, they suddenly found themselves only 2 1/2 games out of
first in this wacky season.
     Martinez triumphed 5-3 on Friday, and WIlliams outdueled Dizzy Dean 3-2
Saturday.  However, the Cardinals refused to give up, winning 6-2 on Sunday.
The Cards captured Monday's game, too, as Steve Carlton outdueled Steve
Rogers 3-2.  ""We're really good against ground ball pitchers because of our
team speed,"" remarked Lou Brock.  ""I don't see why we can't win this
division.""
     The Phillies and Cubs may have some reasons for them.  Two-thirds of
the way through the season, there is a 3-way tie for first.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
     New York at Pittsburgh(August 3-6): 3 straight 3-2 wins for Bucs,
now 2 back - but in 4th!
    ""When your team is in a slump like we are, the worst thing is to play in a
pitcher's park like this,"" spoke Gil Hodges before the series.  Keith
Hernandez added that ""their defense takes away quite a few runs per year,
and it must be giving them an extra 6-7 wins.""  The Pirates have made only
26 errors all season, 6 ahead of the second place Dodgers.  Error totals tend
to be around 50 for the best defensive All-Time teams.
     Rube Foster defeated Sid Fernandez 5-2 Friday, and Candelaria outshone
Seaver 3-2 Saturday, in a game featuring some outstanding defense.  When
Nolan Ryan and two relivers 6-hit the Mets in another 3-2 win Sunday, the
Pirates could once again look forward to a victory getting them back to the
.500 mark.  They had been unable to several times in the past month.  Bert
Blyleven met Dwight Gooden in the afternoon game.  Both pitchers possessed
fantastic stuff, and the only runs scored through eight innings were on home
runs - a solo shot by Rusty Staub of the Mets and a two-run blast by Ralph
Kiner for the Pirates.  The Mets' Darryl Strawberry singled home a run in the
top of the ninth off Jesse Orosco, working his second inning, after Mookie
Wilson pinch-ran for Gary Carter at second.  With one out and a runner on
first, Lee Mazilli was sent in to pinch-hit.  The Pirates countered with Kent
Tekulve, placing him in the fifth spot in the order and putting Barry Bonds in
left field as the ninth place hitter.  Tekulve induced a groundout forcing
Strawberry at second.  He slid hard into Honus Wagner, preventing the
Pirates from turning their fifth double play of the afternoon.  Tekulve
allowed a hit, but Clemente threw Mazilli out at third from near the right
field line, ending the inning.  Tug McGraw relieved Randy Myers, who entered
to pitch the eighth, and got one out before Bonds launched a rocket to deep
center, running through the stop sign at third to score an inside-the-park
homer to win.  The Pirates had scored an improbable 3 straight 3-2 wins,
and had moved to within 2 games of first place, with seven weeks to go.
------------------------------------------------------------------
     San Francisco at Boswaukta(August 3-5): 
    Another Sunday doubleheader appeared on the schedule, as the Giants
managed to close the gap on the other teams thanks to some starting
pitching that just wouldn't tire.  In fact, reported manager John McGraw,
""once this rough part of the schedule is over, maybe as early as this coming
week, we may shift to a 4-man rotation again for a little while.""
     Juan Marichal continued his hot pitching Friday, beating Lew Burdette and
the Braves 4-1.  Willie Mays had all four r.b.i.s on 3 hits.  Rick Reuschel
faced Joe Niekro Saturday in a slugfest.  The Braves' park had been a homer
haven, but this took the cake, as the Giants won a seesaw affair 16-13.
Willie Mays had three homers, Willie McCovey, Eddie Matthews, and Don
Baylor had two, and Hank Aaron, Ernie Lombardi, Biz Mackey, and Mel Ott had
one each.  The Braves had collected 149 home runs going into Sunday's
doubleheader, putting them on a pace for 223, which would be 4 short of the
National League record.  They were still a tad behind the '61 Yankees' pace.
They had allowed over 120, though.  Vida Blue actually got the win after
retiring 2 batters in the fifth.  He allowed only a run in the sixth, but
faltered in the seventh.  Joe McGinnity earned the save.
     In the doubleheader, the Braves' Hoyt Wilhelm failed to hold a lead in the
first game, but Hank Aaron homered off Bill Foster in the eighth as the
Braves won, 4-3.  The Giants took the second game, however, by a 6-2 score.
The homer by Aaron was a magical #150 by the Braves; however, they fell to
three game below .500, making a comeback extremely unlikely.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
     San Diego at Cincinnati(Aug. 3-5):  Randy Jones faced Ewell
Blackwell in the first of this 3-game series, and the Padres felt rather
good.  With Don Mattingly straining his back in the last Cleveland game, the
trade looked even better.  McGriff's batting average was even rising.  Of
course, the bench was very poor, and Joe Gordon was only adequate in the
outfield, but these were minor problems, since the pitching was holding up.
     Jones pitched a good game Friday, and won 6-3.  McGriff launched two
home runs.  Mel Harder earned a win with the help of Mark Davis and Ray
Narleski Saturday; 5-4 was the final score.  Tom Candiotti battled Satchel
Paige to a 3-3 tie through eight innings before departing.  The game was
scoreless for 4 more innings until the thirteenth.  Paige had departed after
10, and John Franco hurled a scoreless inning.  Tom Browning was working
his second scoreless inning, when Dave Winfield doubled with one out and
Joe Gordon was pitched around.  Thurm Munson doubled both runners home,
and the Padres gamed a 5-3 win.  The three-game sweep had pulled the
Giants into a tie with the Reds.  Though the Reds denied it, the highly
emotional series with the Dodgers may have taken too much out of them.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
     Brookangeles at Houston(August 3-5):
     Another series capped off by a weekend doubleheader took place in the
wide open plains of the Astrodome.  The Astros sent Joe Niekro to the hill in
the first game, opposite Don Drysdale.  ""Normally,"" Drysdale remarked, ""I
would be challenging hitter by being ready to throw at them.  I can't afford
to with this team, though; we have to get our own runners going; we can't
Davis will get decked once.""
     The fact that Glenn Davis leads the team in homers with six (!) is
primarily why he would be decked, but it should be understood that his
current pace would give him nine for the season.  The hitting on this team is
a little better, but the power is all doubles and triples.  Still, Carl Furillo is
the main reason no Astro home runs were hit over the weekend, as he threw
two runners out trying for inside-the-park homers.  For those unaware of
the nastness of the Astros' park, they have a 23-foot high gray wall all
around the outfield; balls must be hit into the seats to be home runs.  The
foul poles are 355 feet from home plate, but the alleys are 400 feet away,
with center field at 420 feet.  ""It's as if some three-year-old threw a
tantrum and told his playmates: 'If I can't hit home runs, nobody will hit
home runs',"" remarked Roy Campanella.
     The Dodgers stole five bases Friday, but the Astros decided to revitalize
the Baltimore chopping that had failed 6 weeks before; for tonight, anyway,
Davis, Jim Wynn, and Jose Cruz did not have to mess with their swings,
according to the manager.  After Poles and Willie Wells reached base via the
Baltimore chop, Drysdale decked Jose Cruz with a pitch.  He responded with
a two-run double, but Wynn - playing first for Davis - popped up, and the
Astros didn't score any more in that inning.  They did score 3 in the fourth to
erase a 3-2 deficit, and the Astros wound up winning 6-4.  They threatened
to do even better the next game, as Tommy John would be their opponent.
Walt Alston met privately with the starters at 6 A.M. before the game.
     ""I think I know how we can beat the Baltimore Chop,"" he explained.
     ""How can we do that,"" Pee Wee Reese wondered.
     ""They're going to be beating the ball down, so we've got to be ready to
throw on the run.  Steve will start at first to dig balls out of the dirt, but I
want all of you to practice your barehanded picks and throws.  We'll go with
a shallow infield almost the whole time.""
     The plan almost worked.  Mike Scott allowed only two runs through eight
innings, but the Astros got three; two of them scored when Bill Doran
pushed a bunt into the outfield in the fourth with runners on second and
third.  3-2 Astros was the final, with Dave Smith earning another save.  The
Dodgers scored a victory in the first game of the twin bill Sunday, as Nolan
Ryan walked five, three of whom scored in a 4-1 Dodger win.  Fernando
Valenzuela lost the second game 4-2 to Don Sutton, however, as the Dodgers'
thirteen stolen bases in the series proved to not be enough.
     ""We're mostly a power team,"" remarked Ron Cey.  ""Jackie and, when he
plays, Maury Wills are our only real speed demons, though a couple other
plays can do it now and then.  We're sunk in a place like the Astrodome.  I
guess that's why they're so successful there.""  Indeed, it seems that
basestealing teams give them the most trouble in the dome.  The 'Stros
swiped 12 bases in 16 attempts, giving them 230 on the season.

"David Vergolini writes

Yeah, if the Tigers can keep scoring 20 runs a game.  If I'm reading all this  
woofing correctly, one midseason slump is going to pull this team out of  
contention.  Like Yogi says, I'll believe when I believe it.

"

""Deeply rooted rivalry?"" Ahem, Jokerit have been around since 1967 and joined
the top flight only in the early '70s. Helsingfors IFK have been around since
1897 but fans only started taking hockey seriously in the 1960s so I think
you're exagerating here.


That's a rather bold claim, in the light of how successful the Canadian &
American Olympic teams have been . . . and they've had to play according to our
set of rules and on international ice. The 1992 Olympic teams contained about
as much talent as your average expansion team. Canada had Eric Lindros, Sean
Burke, Joe Juneau and Chris Kontos. Another four or five have been deep subs in
the NHL. As for the Yanks, Keith Tkachuk, Scott Lachance, Bret Hedican, Shawn 
McEachern, Steve Heintze, Ted Donato, Joe Sacco and Bill Guerin have been 
3rd/4th line players in the NHL, while Robb Stauber has done well for the 
Kings in goal. Nothing more. In fact, I'm sure that an All-Star team assembled
from the best Finnish League teams would do no better in the NHL than Hartford 
or Tampa Bay currently are doing.
---
But what happens if _all_ top-class Finnish & Swedish players gradually end up
with Helsinki & Stockholm as the North American-based ones gradually retire and
no Canadian/American team is allowed to draft new players from Scandinavia? 
Here is what THE HOCKEY NEWS scouts think of our NHL-based players:

(28-30=superstar)
(23-27=star)
(18-22=NHL regular+)
(13-17=NHL regular)
( 8-12=role player)

FINLAND:  

D-Jyrki Lumme.......20
D-Teppo Numminen....20
D-Peter Ahola.......13

C-Jari Kurri........25
C-Christian Ruuttu..16

R-Teemu Selanne.....27

L-Esa Tikkanen......20
(Obviously, Selanne's ratings would be higher today than they were in January)

SWEDEN:

This would be interesting. Clearly, Finland's top five players (Winnipeg's
Selanne & Numminen, Vancouver's Lumme, Los Angeles' Jari Kurri and New York's
Tikkanen) are right up there with any five-man unit Pittsburgh & co. have. But
I have my doubts about the home-based Finnish players - the national team did
well in the Canada Cup and World Championships largely due to the efforts of
Markus Ketterer (the goalie), 3-4 or the players listed above and luck. There's
presumably a lot of decent players in Finland that wouldn't be superstars at
the highest level but still valuable role players, however. My guess would be
that the Finnish Canada Cup team would be a .500 team in the NHL.
---
Sweden is easier to judge because they have more players in North America.
Their points total (16 players) is 274 - seven more than Ottawa's 22 top
players combined! If we estimate there are six more NHL regulars back home in 
Sweden, an all-Swedish team would assemble about 350-360 skill points.
Deducting some points from Pittsburgh, NY Rangers and other teams that rely on
Swedish players, the Swedish team would finish in sixth place - about as high
as Boston, Vancouver, Calgary and Montreal on paper! So, the ""dynasty"" talk
isn't completely unfounded here. An all-Finnish/all-Swedish team might have an
advantage because the players would be playing at home half of the time,
won't have to adapt to a foreign country and a foreign language, and presumably
play the wide-open European variant of hockey rather than have to learn the
North American checking game. However, if free agency becomes a factor the top 
Scandinavian players still might end up playing for large-market teams after a 
couple of years the same way Edmonton's ""dynasty"" crumbled in the late '80s. 
Some fringe players likely will be drafted by other NHL teams as having an 
exclusive talent pool might be a bit unfair after all. I'd settle for a 
compromise, prohibit all European teams from signing a North American during 
the first two rounds but allow them to keep their top two players. After this, 
the amateur draft should be open to anyone.

From this account, it doesn't sound like you even saw the goal, Mike. Smith
came out from behind his own net and fired a breakout pass that hit Fuhr in the
back of the leg. Fuhr was backing up at the time and never saw what
happened. The puck went straight off Fuhr's leg and into the net. Fuhr never
had a chance. There was no play back to the goaltender, in fact Perry Berezan
of Calgary had just dumped it in and Smith was retrieving it. 

It was unfortunate that it happened; Smith is a nice guy and was only a rookie
at the time, and on his birthday too. But all the blame lies with him. Starting
in pee-wee coaches tell players never to make a cross-ice pass in front of 
their own net. Too much chance of having it intercepted, or hitting the 
goaltender, or whatever.

And to the people who say that Smith cost the Oilers the series, I can only
say that he certainly didn't cause the team to lose the other three games.
There was no reason for a powerhouse team like Edmonton to be tied late
in the third period of the 7th game of the second round. Everybody on the team
has to take responsibility for them even being in that situation.",sports

As I have read this net the last few days, I am continually amazed at the 
pronouncements of baseball prowess by many individuals.  Especially when it 
comes down to saying that the Bosox haven't a prayer.  As a long time Red Sox
fan, I will simply say:  The Impossible Dream Year - 1967 for those of you
with short memories. short lives, or both.  

To be a Red Sox fan is to continually be the subject of abuse and criticism
from those who only follow 'the hot team'.  This statement is supported based
on the increased number of 'Brave Woofers' out on the net.  A true fan of a 
team, any team, will follow that team through the good years as well as the lean
years, and be amply rewarded when the time is right.  

Yeah, so what if Buckner let a roller go through his legs in `86.  Who cares if
Clemens told Cooley to go piss up a rope and promptly earned a quick shower.  The
fact is, they were one of the best teams in the league those years and the fans
supported them.  Now that it appears that they are on lean times, the number of 
detracters come from all over.  So what!  Let them play and we will see what 
happens come September.  The Red Sox may not be that good, but they are certainly 
not that bad, either and they do have a chance to win the World Series, after all,
remember the `69 Mets?  Who would have given them a chance to even make it that
far, let alone beat Baltimore.

Let's face it, Baseball is a wonderful game and is far more unpredictable than Football
and Basketball.  Because of this, one can never say with absolute certainity what
the outcome will be over the course of 162 games.",sports

You obviously don't understand how TV scheduling works.  ESPN had
prior contracts to baseball to show Monday night games and had
contracted all the other bs shows well in advance.  The NHL TV deal
was very late in the scheduling process (you normally have to do this
one-plus year out.  The NHL package was finished two weeks before the
season started).  ESPN has shown tremendous commitment to the NHL by
squeezing in extra telecasts when it could (like the last Minnesota
game) and putting Stanley Cup games as backup to their baseball
telecasts (which by favorable circumstances they could pull off last
night).

But the bottom line is that ESPN cannot break contracts at will.  They
must honor the previous deals they made.  $$$$ _does_ have something
to do with it, especially if you risk a $$$$$$$$ lawsuit for breach of
contract with baseball.

"Let's look at the effects of inflation on 1930's superstars' salaries.

I read once that the Babe made $80,000 one year and that was about as good 
as it got for him.

Let's assume he made that in 1928 (I'm not sure of the figures, but I know
I'm in the ballpark--pun intended). :-)

Today, assuming a 4% yearly inflation rate, which is an understatement if
not accurate, his measly $80,000 salary would be worth.

FV = $80,000 x (1+4%)^(1993-1928)
   = $80,000 x (1.04)^65
   = just over $1,000,000.

Assuming inflation is average of around 5%.

FV = $80,000 x (1+5%)^65
   = almost 2,000,000.

(I didn't crunch these numbers beforehand).

These numbers might lead one to believe that today's players are slightly 
overpaid.  The Babe appears to have made then what today's average to above
average players make now.  Perfectly accurate salary, year of salary, and 
average inflation rate would make this analysis more accurate, but I don`t

Gainey is the best defensive forward ever.  I stand by that assessment.

ever watch him play? He never made a technical error.

To knowledgeable observers of the game my meaning is obvious.  Your
hockey education is not my responsibility.
 

He was just another player.  To laud him as anything more I find
bothersome.  I hated the Habs.  I hated Lafleur until I realized
that he was likely the most aesthetically pleasing player to ever 
skate in my lifetime.  Why would anyone talk about Gainey?
  


Did he play hockey at a high level?  Was he any good?  If not, why
would you bother to bring JC up?  I am talking about hockey players

said previously, it is not my responsibility to educate you.

discussing.




That is an excellent idea and if I decide to waste any more time
responding to any of your, or Greg's, postings then I will be sure
to implement that very macro.
 

Tarasov claimed that Gainey was a ""hockey god.""  And Greg ate it up.

Gretzky, Lemieux, Gilmour etc do not play the role of checking centreman.
They play an offensive role as opposed to a defensive one.  If they
were used as defensive centres it would be a waste of their offensive
abilities. 

When you compare Gretzky et al to Jarvis, Gainey etc you are comparing 
apples and oranges.  It is like me telling you that Felix Potvin isn't 
very good because a team would be better if the had Lemieux instead of
him.  Sure Lemieux is a better player, but he is a different type of
player.  For a team to be successful, they need to have all types of
players- this includes defensive forwards.

When compared with other defensive forwards, Bob Gainey is the greatest
defensive forward ever.  He is the player who's talents best suited being
a defensive forward- who completely dominated the game when he played.

Maybe if a more talented player such as Gretzky had decided to waste his
offensive talents and play defensively, he could have been a better
defensive forward, but he wasn't.

 Besides, if Messier can't take the heat, he should stay out of the kitchen.

 Well Matt, Mattias Timmander hasn't been playing with the MoDo elite league
 team yet (just the MoDo junior team), so I predict he needs a few more years
 here before he can join the B's. I saw him play in the Swedish championship
 game for junior players this year, and he played very well, a physical game,
 but not the kind of rough stuff that Ulfie does (I suspect you would like to
 have a Ulf type-of-player on the B's team too? :)
 As for Mariusz Czerkawski, he has had a *great* season for Hammarby in
 division 1. He scored -if I remember correctly- 93 points this season,
 and then we have to keep in mind that a 50+ point season in Sweden is
 considered *very good* due to the limited number of games. Mariusz is
 Djurgarden property (he was just on loan to Hammarby), so he will play
 in Elitserien next season, unless the B's can get him of course.
 I would say that Mariusz has to be one of the most exciting player to
 watch in Swedish hockey this season.

	Hartford, Lenarduzzi, 1-1-1 (38 - 33)

On the first Hartford goal, Gord Hynes misplayed the puck at the FLYERS blue
line and Nylander stripped him and took off.

The Recchi goal was a 2 on 1 with Lindros.

The Bowen goal was just a puck he threw at the net, got a good carom and it
ended up behind the goalie.

On the second Nylander goal he got three whacks at the puck before it went in.
This is the most frustrating part of the FLYERS defense. Take the body, and if
they get one shot and beat you fine. Don't give them another chance. Carkner,
Galley and McGill are all terrible about this, I'll bet money at least one of
them was the closest FLYER to the play.

That's all I have, my radio got bad after that and I was lucky to know who it
was that scored, much less how.

From what I heard, Roussel had a very strong game. After the game, Gene Hart
asked Bobby Taylor to pick the three stars of the season rather than of the
game. It was Garry Galley #3 for his career high point total (I'm surprised
that a former goalie wouldn't look closer at his defensive play), Tommy 
Soderstrom #2 for his team record tying 5 shutouts in only about 1/2 a season
and, Mark Recchi #1 for his all time high team single season scoring mark.
But here's the odd part. He couldn't decide between Lindros and Recchi for
number 1. If he picks Recchi as #1 after he had a hard time choosing between
him and Lindros, doesn't that make Lindros #2????

What? You wanna know my three stars of the season? Well, since you asked...

#1 Eric Lindros. Eric dominates a game simply by stepping out onto the ice.
The difference between the team's record with him and without him is no
accident. I believe that the team could have been almost as successful without
Recchi. There is no question that this team is significantly better with Eric
Lindros on it, and I think that he will deservedly wear the 'C' on his jersey
next season.

#2 Tommy Soderstrom. 5 shutouts was second in the league to only Ed Belfour,
and Tommy didn't have a Chris Chelios (booo) in front of him. He also didn't
play a complete season due to heart problems (sentimental edge here, my family
has a history of heart problems). There's no question in my mind that Tommy
Soderstrom is this teams goalie of the future, and if Roussel complains again
about being number 2 look for him to be traded within 2 years.

#3 Mark Recchi. Again, you can't argue with an all-time team high single season
scoring mark. There are an awful lot of teams that didn't have a single player
get as many points. Plus, Mark is the only FLYER to play the entire season.
Not a tough choice.

Honorable mentions: Rod Brind'Amour topped his single season high point total
which he set last year. The difference was that he wasn't on the top line
this year and didn't get as much playing time. Then again, he didn't get the
defensive attention that he got last year from the other team either.

Dimtri Yushkevich was the teams most consistent defenseman. Yes, he made rookie
mistakes, but he was usually fast enough to make up for them. I have a feeling
that with his shot he'll score a few more points next year without giving up
anything in his own zone, and I suspect that he'll be the teams top defenseman
in years to come.

Garry Galley was the team's point leader from defensemen. Again, there are some
things you just can't argue with. And he battled with chronic fatigue syndrome,
he certainly deserves kudos for only missing one game, and that was against his
wishes under doctors orders. But his defensive play often negates his offensive
contribution. A little more caution, and a little bit smarter in his own end
will make him a much more important part of the team next year.

Brent Fedyk was the leagues biggest improvement over last years point total.
But consistency became a problem for him.

The FLYERS end the season 1 game below .500 in 5th place, their best winning
percentage since going .500 in 1988-89. 14-20-3 within the division (4th in
Patrick), 23-14-5 at home. They finished 17th overall, will draft 10th in
next years entry draft (Quebec had the 1st rounder, though). They scored as
many goals as they allowed, 319.

The 8 straight wins is the most since they won 13 in a row in 1985.

I will be sending out final stats as soon as I get the issue of the Hockey
News that contains them, since there are no more games for me to go to I have
no other way of getting them.

I hope you've all enjoyed this years hockey season as much as I have. Knowing
the future that we have coming to us made missing the playoffs one more time
almost bearable.

Well, it seems that the Habs have been much talked-about of late, so here's my
$0.02.  These guys have absolutely no concept of how to play in front of the
damn net!!!  Watch them in the offensive zone, especially on the powerplay. 
Damphousse or Lebeau will skate all over the bloody zone, maybe pass to the
point, get it back, skate some more, pass it around....BUT WHERE'S THE SHOT??!
Answer: the shot is totally useless because they lack a forward who stands
in front of the net a la` Neely, Shanahan, Tocchet, etc etc.  Too bad 
Demers won't put Dipietro or LeClair on the powerplay more often.  Dammit,
even Ewen would at least cause some disruptions.  Montreal desperately needs
a power forward with some talent, IMO.

Then watch them in their own zone. Patrick Roy is screened on everything. Say
what you want about his performance; IMNSHO he cannot stop what he cannot see. 
And Montreal's defence does a miserable job of clearing the front of the net. 
Last night against Washington Roy played a *great* game.  The first goal came
on the most ridiculous goalmouth scramble I've seen in a long time, and he
didn't have a hope in hell of stopping the shot.  The second goal came on a
deflection of a shot he only partially saw anyway.  Pathetic defence.  The
third goal was EN.

No wonder he gets pissed off at his defencemen.

Never was?  Probably.  Is not now?  Debatable.  What other valid test can

joke!


If I remember right, Brad Park was also involved in that trade.  He wasn't
all that bad a hockey player.

But let's look at some of Sinden's trades over the years:

??? for Rick Middleton (Rangers).  I don't know who Sinden gave up for Middle-
ton, so I'll call this one a +.

Barry Pederson for Cam Neely (Canucks).  +++.  Any questions?

Greg Hawgood for Vladimir Ruzicka (Oilers). ++.  Didja see that one Rosie
roofed against Roy in last year's playoffs?

Courtnall/Ranford for Andy Moog (Oilers).  A wash.  Moog is a good goaltender,
Ranford burned Boston in the Finals in his first year, and Courtnall always
seems to get his points.  Anyone in Vancouver care to comment on Courtnall
as a defensive liability?

Ken Linseman for Dave Poulin (Flyers) ++.  Any more questions?

Janney/Quintal for Adam Oates (Blues).  ++.  Janney is an enormous talent and
a personable guy, the the Bruins play in Adam's Division.  Enough said?

So,even if you count the Esposito/Vadnais/Ratelle/Park/I don't remember who 
else (Joe Zanussi?) trade as a double minus, Harry the Horse trader comes
out on top.  I submit that the Bruins are always good because of Harry, not
in spite of him.

BTW, do you really think the Habs will bounce back next season.  I'll bet 
they finish fourth or fifth in the Conference, behind any of the following:
Pittsburgh, Quebec, Boston, Washington, Islanders.  Someone correct me if
these five teams will not be in Montreal's conference.

In summary, things look bleak for the Habs, at least in the near future.  I
suspect that the next team from La Belle Province to win the Cup will be
that team that Lindros didn't want to play for.

You're right about the signal being strong. I live in West Philadelphia,

AL), and the Eagles aren't too bad either. There are two big problems:

	1)Total emphasis on the home teams, especially the Eagles. Unlike
	  the FAN hosts, who can at least answer a question about an
	  out-of-town team if a caller asks, the WIP hosts seem
 	  to have no clue about any team that doesn't play on

	  minutes) gives sports news and scores from around the
	  country. It's very rare to hear an out-of-town score
	  being reported on WIP.

	2)The hosts. With the exception of Jody MacDonald, who I miss

	  both a broad knowledge of the sport or a good on-air presence.
	  The worst is Gary Cobb, who seems to have been hired solely

As far as I know, Toronto, Pittsburgh, and New York (NL) change their
uniforms every year.  Every other year (e.g., New York), it will say Mets
in cursive, New York in cursive, or New York in all caps.  Minor changes,
but they do change them often.  Last year, I think they had New York in all
caps.  Did Toronto have Blue Jays or Toronto last year?  What about
Pittsburgh?


I hate the gray.  They should opt for more color (like the White Sox).

: In any case, I think Viola would have made a better signing.  Why?
: Viola is younger, and is left handed (how many left handed starters does
: Toronto have?

Well, I agree that Viola is a better signing.  However, why does
everyone say that you want lefthanded starters?  I understand lefthanded
spot relievers, even though they usually face more righthanded batters
than lefthanded batters.  I just don't understand why people insist
on lefthanded starters, unless there is a park effect (e.g., Yankee Stadium).
Most batters in MLB are righthanded, so righthanded starters will have
the platoon advantage more often than lefthanded starters.
I guess one argument for lefty starters is that certain teams
may be more vulnerable to LHP's than RHP's.  However, this is probably
only a factor in the postseason, because teams seldom juggle their starters
for this reason during the regular season.

I think you just want the best starters you can get, regardless of
whether they are lefties or righties.  Lefthanded starters tend to have
higher ERA's than righthanded starters, precisely because managers
go out of their way to start inferior lefties (or perhaps because of
the platoon advantage).

Am I missing something here?",sports

:   plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.

Not necessarily the most misleading, but you are right, it definitely
needs to be taken in the proper perspective. A shining example is
if you look at the Penguins individual +/-, you will find very few minuses.
That only makes common sense, since they didn't lose many games.

:   Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice
:   time per game and some measure of its ""quality"" (i.e., is the player put out
:   in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up
:   against the other team's top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), I would
:   much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious
:   merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.

Unfortunately, you will need to keep a ridiculous number of stats to
really come up with a statistic which really shows a player's value.
Let's just enjoy the game and not overanalyze it. (like I'm doing now,
excuse me!)

I disagree.  McNall has demonstrated with Gretzky that a star brings out the
crowds whether or not the team is expected to do well.  Very few fans real-
istically expect the Kings to do well this year (although I do) and yet they
still go out to see Gretzky.  This is the marketing strategy - selling the
game by selling the stars - that is employed by Baseball and, notably, the
NBA and this is the attitude that the new Bettman/McNall leadership is 
bringing to the league.  They have gone on record as stating that they are
trying to sell the game on its stars.  Timo Salami and Brett Hull are perfect 
examples of players that real fans know aren't worth a damn and yet, being
benificiaries of marketing-oriented coaching strategies, have goal totals
that would indicate to the casual observer, the very fans the NHL wants to
attract, that these players are indeed superstars.



It ain't nearly so simple as this.  The casual fan doesn't think about much 
at all.  Can you actually find an adult with a 3 digit IQ who believes that
McDonalds makes good hamburgers?
 

Yes but apparently the Rocket has not lived up to his marketing responsi-
bilities has he?  He was hyped, initially, as a superstar, but outside of
one Grey Cup game he has done very little to maintain/enhance that assess-
ment of his talents.  Most Argo fans probably feel the team would be better
off without him.

Trashy move from a trashy organization. After the front
office stated that nobody would lose their job over the

Just the kind of experience you need when trying to build
an expansion franchise. He'll probably be in the Hall of

Lou wanted Morris all along.  The idiot.  Giving the man $40 million
to play with is like giving a five year old a loaded Uzi with the
safety off.  The only question is how many shots he will get off
before somebody is wise enough to take it away.


I don't see why people expect Boston to finish sixth.  The bottom four
teams last year were essentially tied.  Boston, in seventh place, had
73 wins.  The Yankees and Indians, tied for fourth place, had 76 wins.

Now I should think it is obvious that the Red Sox improved more than
the Indians or Tigers.  Basically, the Red Sox are stronger this year
at 1B, DH, SS, LF, and RF.  They have healthier starting pitchers (so
far, at least) and better relievers.  I see no reason why they
shouldn't win ~85 games.  Meanwhile, the Indians are in shambles and
the Tigers *still* have no pitching.  They will win some 20-3
blowouts, but they will lose an awful lot of 7-5 games too.

*MAYBE* the Sox will play poorly, win 78 games, and finish fifth.
But I think third or fourth place is more likely.",sports
"
Let's start over.  I'm not arguing about who is the better goaltender.  I'd
take Soderstrom right now.  What I am saying is that Roussel can be a #1
netminder.  The GAA difference is less than half a goal per game (less than
that after last night), their save percentages are close, and their records
are similar.  And with that, I just don't see how you can label Roussel as
the most disappointing player on the Flyers this season.

You say Soderstrom played against better competition.  That may very well
be, but there is no way of knowing how Roussel would have performed in
those games.  Besides, against the better scoring teams like Pittsburgh,
the defense is more keyed up than they are against San Jose.


But I'm not just judging Roussel on that game alone.  I've seen him play
for the past two seasons in Philly and before that in Hershey.  It's just
my opinion, but I think he's got what it takes.  Of course, I thought that
about Mark LaForest, too.  But I never did about Wendell Young.  So I'm
batting .500 in judging Hershey talent since the Hextall-era.

As for the Rangers game, you can say he was saved by a mistake by the
offensive player if you like.  But Rou had his leg in position to make the
save.  If he didn't, it wouldn't have mattered if the Rangers player didn't
get the puck up or not.  It would have been a goal.  On a breakaway that's
what the goalie wants to do, take away as much as possible and force the
shooter to beat him.


I seem to remember Roussel doing an excellent job against Pittsurgh on
opening night to give the Flyers a tie against the two-time defending
champs.  And not to take anything away from Soderstrom because he was
senational in that game agains the Habs.  But you can't tell me that a
Montreal player had an open net to shoot at some point during that game
and just flat out missed it.  Mistakes, both on offense and defense are
part of the game.  Or there'd never be shutouts.

Anyway, I'm happy the Flyers have both Soderstrom and Roussel and
I'm not going to argue about it anymore.  Besides, with the current
7-game winning streak and expectations soaring for next year, I
don't want to piss you off to the point that you don't sell me any
tickets next season:-).",sports

Re Eric: True, but fortunately we didn't get to find out what they would be
like without Recchi for 30 games.

Soderstrom: Absolutely. 4 shutouts in 39 games for a rookie without a lot
of defense in front of him. Runnerups to Galley and Fedyk who are scoring
a ton over their career best. But Galley thinks he's Paul Coffey (puts scoring
ahead of defending) and Fedyk has tailed off big time.

Eklund: Was a big question mark this year and was coming off injuries. 42
points in 49 games is not bad at all, and recently he's been a huge factor
in the wins they've gotten. Eklund has never had a point a game season in
his career, his production is very typical for him. How does he qualify as
a disappointment? If anything he's a surprise.

My choice would be Roussel if I went strictly by what was expected of players,
but I never thought that he had what it takes to be a #1 goalie. My biggest
disappointment is Bill Dineen. I thought that he was going to be the perfect
coach for this young team, instead he's made too many bad moves and IMHO
has cost them enough games to keep them out of the playoffs this year. Any
coach that thinks putting Eric Lindros at the point on power plays is a
bright idea needs to go back to coaching school.",sports

I like Alomar.  But I'd like to differ with your opinion about ""a city

I attended many games last year during the balloting.  I know that a
great number of the attendees DID NOT fill out their ballots, but left
them, beer soaked and torn on the floor of the stands.  Toronto gets
no more and no less votes than any other city for the All Star game.

Unfortunately, this is not a one time thing.  I've attended games
during the last four seasons, and it has happened every time.  The
apathetic attitude to All Star ballots really offends me.",sports

I agree, with Marty McSorely and Warren Rychel running a close second and 
third. I am surprised more people have not noted Knickle as the biggest
surprise, even though I personally do not really rate him well. The biggest 
disappointment has to be Carson. Though this is really unfair, since too much 
was expected of him. The second biggest disappointment is Melrose, with his 
adolescent handling of the goaltending problems. Putting Hrudey on the bench 
for a month is just stupid. It did not contribute to the team coming out of 
its slump. MVP is surely Robitaille.",sports

"Amazingly, pitchers, no matter how good their mechanics, are
not machines.  Cy Young winners don't pitch in a vaccuum, unaware
of how their offenses are doing.

	The Braves' pitching staff is already showing signs of
cracking under the strain of knowing they're not going to get many
(if any) runs.  Unfortunately, the Braves' pitchers were so bad for so
long that the organization put so much stress (and I mean *stress*)

""Ryne Sandberg is ahead of schedule in his recovery from a broken

Lefebvre said Friday.
Doctors cleared Sandberg to swing a padded bat at a ball in his

Lefebvre.  '' He's a fast healer, and he doesn't like being on the

Punch Imlach's contributions as a coach and GM were far greater than
those of the above combined.  Should we name a division or trophy after
him?  Smythe and Norris and the bunch were honoured purely because they
were powerful owners.  As owners they certainly did help to build the
league but whether they developed the game is another question altogether.
Are we going to honour those who contributed to the league's evolution
or are we going to honour those who contributed to the glory of the 
sport itself?   


I can't disagree with you here.



What have you heard?  The Major was the *definitive* little asshole!  He
originated the phrase ""if you can't beat 'em in the alley you can't beat
'em on the ice.""  That was his idea of hockey.  Do you think, by chance,
that Don Cherry is a classy individual?


The money issue is irrelevant to the point that we would agree on, and
that is: ""it is the players that are what make the game great and not the
people who put them on the ice""

Exactly true.  Naming divisions and trophies after Smythe and the bunch
is the same kind of nepotism that put Stein in the hall of fame.  I have
always thought that this was nonsense.

"Well, I have compiled some statistics on the entries of my pool.  There

Detroit:	4  (3 in 6, 1 in 7)

Uh, right.  You also forgot that you can't get an RBI (barring a HR) with
nobody on base.  What fraction of all runs come on solo HR?

Most runs are scored because there happened to be players on base when the
batter did something good.  I use the phrase ""happened to be"" advisedly.
Lots of people have tried to figure out who the players are who have the
most ability to ""turn it up a notch"" in clutch/RBI/whatever situations, and
what they've found is that there is no evidence that *anyone* has such an
ability to any measurable extent.  There are no clutch hitters.  People who
tend to do things that *would* cause an RBI if there were somebody on base
end up getting RBIs proportional to how many of their teammates obliged by
being in position.  


I agree.

Um, surely you didn't intend to compare the '93 Reds with the
29 Philidelphia A's.  The Yankees were finishing 2nd to
a team that was as good as the 26-28 Yankees, while the
Yankees had aged some from their peak years.  Ruth and Gehrig
couldn't play every position simultaneously.

IMO, given the various ages of the Braves and Reds this season,
that the Braves will be closer to their peak, while the Reds
have slightly passed their peak.

Also, if you're going to compare Braves and Yankees, a more appropriate
comparison to the '93 Braves might be the '23 Yankees.  
After falling short two years in a row in exciting World Series,
 both teams won/will win the Series this year, despite the
heroics of some old fart on the other team.

	Sigh.
	This was written about the game NHLPA Hockey '93. Which does not
have precise up-to-date rosters. Why don't people think before they post?
Jeez...

"Ten years ago, the number of Europeans in the NHL was roughly a quarter
of what it is now. Going into the 1992/93 season, the numbers of Euros on
NHL teams have escalated to the following stats:

Canadians: 400
Americans: 100
Europeans: 100

   Please note that these numbers are rounded off, and taken from the top
25 players on each of the 24 teams. My source is the Vancouver Sun.

   Here's the point: there are far too many Europeans in the NHL. I am sick
of watching a game between an American and a Canadian team (let's say, the
Red Wings and the Canucks) and seeing names like ""Bure"" ""Konstantinov"" and
""Borshevshky"". Is this North America or isn't it? Toronto, Detriot, Quebec,
and Edmonton are particularly annoying, but the numbers of Euros on other
teams is getting worse as well. 

    I live in Vancouver and if I hear one more word about ""Pavel Bure, the
Russian Rocket"" I will completely throw up. As it is now, every time I see
the Canucks play I keep hoping someone will cross-check Bure into the plexiglassso hard they have to carry him out on a stretcher. (By the way, I'm not a
Canucks fan to begin with ;-). 

    Okay, the stretcher remark was a little carried away. But the point is that
I resent NHL owners drafting all these Europeans INSTEAD of Canadians (and
some Americans). It denies young Canadians the opportunity to play in THEIR
NORTH AMERICAN LEAGUE and instead gives it to Europeans, who aren't even
better hockey players. It's all hype. This ""European mystique"" is sickening,
but until NHL owners get over it, Canadian and American players will continue
to have to fight harder to get drafted into their own league.

    With the numbers of Euros in the NHL escalating, the problem is clearly
only getting worse.

    I'm all for the creation of a European Hockey League, and let the Bures
and Selannes of the world play on their own continent.

    I just don't want them on mine.

Well, my question still hasn't been answered: if Spanky was bad enough to
release this year, why did he get so much playing time last year?  Yes, I know
he was part of a platoon, and that's why he got more playing time than
Slaught, but that doesn't answer the question.  If Slaught was so obviously
better this year, wasn't this also obvious last year, and shouldn't he
have been taking away some of Spanky's playing time against righties?",sports
"
Yes.  But this is *irrelevant*.  You're talking about averages, when we
have lots of information about THIS PLAYER IN PARTICULAR to base our
decisions on.

I might as well say ""We know that very, very few people are more than 7 feet
tall, so chances are that Manute Bol is really only 6 foot 4.""


Why isn't Lopez likely to hit that well?  He hit that well last year (after
adjusting his stats for park and league and such); he hit better (on an
absolute scale) than Olson or Berryhill did.  By a lot.

As for rushing...  If there really is a qualitative difference between the
minors and the majors that requires a period of adjustment (and I don't
believe there is), then wouldn't you rather waste Lopez's 22-year old good
season than his 23-year old very good season or his 24-year-old excellent
season?  The sooner you get him acclimated, the more of his prime you get to
use.


The point was not that 17 AB is a significant sample, but rather that he
hadn't done anything in spring training to cause even a blockhead manager
to question whether his minor league numbers were for real, or to send him
down ""until he gets warmed up"".


Most players are *never* ready for the bigs.  What does this have to do
with Javy Lopez?


See above.  


But I could apply the same reasoning to Frank Thomas or Barry Bonds.  Most
players aren't that good, so they probably won't be that good this year
either.


And demonstrated inabilities to hit their way out of a soap bubble.


Not superstars, not stars, not even good players.  Maybe average, if we're
being charitable.


Ummm.  Justice is a very fine hitter.  Pendleton might have another big year
in his bat, but he might also spend the season in Hamstring Hell.  Gant is a
big question mark.  The Bream/Hunter platoon is decent (not excellent) and
has rotten OBP or SLG (depending on who's in).  Blauser is a very valuable
bat... for a shortstop.



Wanna bet?  The difference between Lopez's bat and Olson/Berryhill could be
20 or 30 runs over the course of the season.  Given a choice between a player
with experience and a player who can play, I'll take the latter every time.


Just like Keith Mitchell did?


That was me, and you so far your only counter-proposal is that they
really don't understand how good Lopez is, or overvalue experience,
or some combination of the two.  I think my interpretation was more
flattering to the organization.

How was this trade bad? I seem to recall Ratelle and Middleton making a pretty
good centre - right wing combination, and the Bruins also got Brad Park in the
deal (and they also lost Vadnais and somebody else). After the trade, the 
Bruins were in two finals and one semi-final, all of which, of course, they 
lost to Montreal (which should please you to no end). I doubt, however, keeping
Esposito would have made a difference in those series, as he did not for
the Rangers in '79 (or any of his years in Boston, for that matter).

"April 1, 1993


I am participating in an NL-league that uses standard Rotisserie rules
except that the following catagories are used:

For position players:
	lowest batting average
	strike-outs
	caught-stealing
	errors

For pitchers:
	losses
	blown saves
	higest ERA
	'taters allowed

This is the fifth year that I've participated in this Blowtisserie
league.  Last year I won the pennant due primarily to the fact that
I had terrible pitching.  I would like to lower my batting average
which is rather high because I do have Jose Offerman (who made up
for this by helping me lock first place in errors).  Anyway,
someone offered:

Andres Gallaraga for Bud Black

I can afford to give up Bud Black because I still have Kyle Abbott.
However, I am afraid of Andres actually doing well this season.
Should I make the trade or not?

Amusing, isn't it?  Seems only the SDCNs realize how much baseball is
a *team* game, combining efforts from every player for the win.

Consider the Red Sox game last night.  The Sox won 4-3 in the bottom
of the 13th.  Who won the game?

-Clemens pitched a strong nine (?) innings, allowing only two runs.
-Ryan pitched a couple shutout innings, though he needed some excellent
 defensive plays behind him to do so.
-Quantrill pitched a couple of innings, gave up the go-ahead run, and
 got credited with the win when the Sox scored two in the bottom of
 the inning.

Looks like a team effort to me!  Yet only Quantrill got credit for
the win.

How about the offense?
-Dawson and Vaughn hit (I think) HRs early in the game.  Without either
 one, the Sox would have lost in nine.
-Quintana led off the 13th with a solid single.
-Zupcic pinch-ran for Quintana, providing the speed to go from first
 to third when...
-Cooper ripped a *second* single in the inning.
-Melvin avoided the DP, getting the run home with a sac fly.  Not much of
 a help, but it was something.
-Scrub Richardson then hit a double, scoring the speedy Cooper all the
 way from first!  (Hill's lack of defense helped.)

Cooper and Zupcic were credited with runs, Melvin and Richardson were
credited with RBIs.  But it seems to me that it was Quintana's hit
that set up the whole inning!  And did Melvin really contribute as
much as Richardson?

Furthermore, people seem to consider RBIs to be more significant than
runs.  Did Melvin contribute more than Cooper?  Cooper provided the
game-winning baserunner, and moved the tying run to third base with
only one out!

Assigning credit based on Runs and RBIs is clearly ridiculous.  You
can argue that OBP and SLG don't show you who came through in the
clutch, but R&RBI don't do any better.  At least OBP and SLG don't
*claim* to try to tell you that.

Here's to the Red Sox who contributed to last night's victory.

There are many teams in the NHL who have taken a liking to Russian players.
The ""whole Russian strategy"" is not specific to Detroit or to Devellano,
who was GM before Murray.  What the previous GM also did was to trade 
away several players who have gone on to do well with other teams, most
notably (in my memory) Murray Craven, who had a few very good years with
Philly after leaving here.  Also, it's not the volume of trades that will 
necessarily improve a team, but the quality of them.  Trading Adam Oates
for Bernie Federko was just plain stupid, even if Federko used to be a 
great player at one time.  Most of Murray's trades have worked significantly
to the Wings' advantage, with those that didn't being soured mainly by 
injury to the players involved (such as Troy Crowder, who suffered back
problems from which he never really recovered).

This brings up a question I asked myself (no answer) when it was mentionned
that the NHL could expand in Europe.

Would most of the North-americans now playing in the NHL be willing
to play for a team in Europe?

I do not think that the majority of hockey players are necessarily
interested in expanding their cultural experience to that level.
(I know I would but I am not a pro hockey player)

When one recalls some players remarks in the last few years it makes
me wonder how a European expansion could be achieved.  Remember these:

- Lindros did not want to play in Quebec (for more than $ reasons)
- Nicholls ... in Edmonton.
- R. Courtnall wanted to be traded to LA only.
- C. Lemieux said he would refuse to go to Edmonton earlier this year.

I know there are many non-cultural reasons behind these but there is more:

- Some american players who played for the Expos complained about the french
  fact and that the city was not quite like the other US cities.  One
  players' wife trying to make her point went on to complain that she could
  not even find her favorite brand of nacho chips in Montreal.

Anybody knows what happened when all these US football players moved
to London, Spain, etc .. for the one year of that new football league
(2 years ago?)

My votes (FWIW):

Team MVP: Pat Verbeek. He fans on 25% of goal mouth feeds, but he still has 
36 goals after a terrible start and has been an examplary (sp?) team captain
throughout a tough couple of seasons. Honorable mention: Nick Kypreos and
Mark Janssens. Probably more appropriate in the unsung heroes category than
MVP, but Kypreos (17 goals, 320+ PIM) has been the hardest working player on
the team and Janssens is underrated as a defensive center and checker. I guess
I place a greater emphasis on hard work than skill when determining value.

Biggest surprise: Geoff Sanderson. He had 13 goals and 31 points last season
as a center, then moved to left wing and has so far put up 45 goals and 80+
points. He now has a new Whaler record 21 power play goals, most all coming
from the right wing faceoff circle, his garden spot. Honorable mention: Andrew
Cassels and Terry Yake. The kiddie quartet of Sanderson, Poulin, Nylander, and
Petrovicky have been attracting the most attention, but Cassels is just 23
and will score close to 90 points this season. He has quite nicely assumed the
role of number one center on the team and works very well with Sanderson. Yake
bounced around the minors for a number of seasons but is still 24 and will put
up about 20 goals and 50 points this season. Yake, like Sanderson, started
performing better offensively once he was converted from center to wing, 
although lefty Sanderson went to the left wing and righty Yake went to the
right side.

Biggest disappointment: Hands down, John Cullen. Cullen had a disasterous 77
point season last year, his first full season after The Trade. Cullen started
the season off of summer back surgery, and fell flat on his face (appropriate,
since he spent all of his Whaler career flat on his ass, and whining about it).
Cullen scored just 9 point on 19 games, was a clubhouse malcontent, commanded
the powerplay to a 9% success percentage (>21% with Sanderson), and sulked his
way out of town. Worst of all, his 4 year, $4M contract had three years left
to run, so no one would give up any more than the 2nd round draft pick the 
Maple Leafs offered to Hartford. Honorable mention: Steve Konroyd, also subpar
after signing a 3 year, $2.1M contract; Eric Weinrich, who showed flashes of
competence, but overall has played poorly; Jim McKenzie, who was a much better
hockey player two seasons ago than he is now; and Frank Pietrangelo, who only
seemed to play well when Sean Burke was out for an extended period and he got
to make a number of starts in a row.",sports
"	Ah, so now we're into European player bashing?  What next?

There are ALWAYS scalpers with tickets outside the Arena.  You might have
to pay a few bucks extra, but you can always find them.  Look on the
street under the message board, or out on the street in front of the Hyatt,
or even around Gate 1.  The later you buy them, the less money you'll pay,
and during the regular season you could usually find some for near face
value or below if you wait until game time.  Might be better to pick them
up earlier now, though.",sports

You know... after I finished laughing I thought:  This would be a great
final.  Two Canadian teams with lots of tradition and all that Don Cherry
nonsense behind them and a nail-biter finish.

Of course, I would prefer a Vancouver--Montreal final with Vancouver
scoring the final goal....

Pity neither will happen.",sports

How do you figure that??  When Bryan Murray took over the Wings they were
a pretty good team that was contending for the Stanley Cup but looked
unlikely to win it.  Now they are a pretty good team that is contending for
the Stanley Cup but looks unlikely to win it.  A truly great GM would
have been able to make the moves to push the team to the upper echelon
of the NHL and maybe win the Stanley Cup.  A good GM (like Murray) can
maintain the team's success but can't push them to the next level.

In the history of hockey there have been several better GM's than Murray-
way too many to name.  Murray isn't even the best GM in the league today.
He fails in comparison to Sinden, Sather, Savard, Caron, Fletcher and
Quinn in my estimation.

I can't imagine how Bryan Murray can be the best GM anyone has ever seen
in hockey- unless they have seen VERY few GM's.",sports

C'mon, Tommy Soderstrom is having a fine rookie (I think he's a rookie)
season with the Flyers. I'm sure most of you knew that already, but just
in case. ",sports

I don't personally, but Clay just posted it.  Yes, we do.  

Unfortunately, it shows that Lopez wasn't as good an example as Nieves would
have been, since his last year numbers were out of line with the previous
years (which I didn't have access to).

The point remains, though; knowing a guy's minor league history is as good
as knowing his major league history, if you know how to read it.


The MLE is not a *projection*, it's an *equivalence*.  It's a ""this is how
well he hit *last* year, in major league terms"" rating.  So, in essence, he
has *already* reached it.  I would guess (Bob?  Clay?) that essentially half
of all players surpass their previous MLEs in their rookie seasons.  Maybe
more than half, since all of these players are young and improving.


Did they?  Offerman may have been the difference between 4th or 5th place
and last place, but no more.


Sure; they didn't have anyone better.  I suppose they might have gutted the
farm system to acquire Jay Bell or Spike Owen or somebody if they were really
in contention. 


If you'd read what I wrote, you'd be less amazed.  Nowhere do I claim to put
any credence in spring training.  Quite the contrary; I said that Lopez hadn't
done anything that even the bozos who *do* put credence in spring training
could interpret as ""failure"".  Just because I think spring training numbers
are meaningless doesn't mean that Bobby Cox does; it's just a case of ruling
out one possible explanation for sending Lopez down.


Keith Mitchell did very very well at AA, AAA, and the majors over a season,
then did very, very poorly for a year in AAA.

Actually, for the Padres this year so far it's 23%.  They are 5th in
the league in HRs, and ALL have been solo shots.

Pythagorean projection puts them at .360 winning percentage
or 58-104.  Need some pitching help, fast!

Good news, though, is that Hurst has been throwing curveballs
w/o any pain.  Threw 80 pitches yesterday.  Should be back
in a couple of weeks.  Maybe we can trade him to the Yankees
for Militello.

  Ah, so you finally found a use for that super slo-mo and frame advance
other than scrutinizing ""Sorority Babes in Heat"". Congrats! 


  Trust me, you'd have a helluva time manipulating them. Besides, if you
converted the film to video you'd have all kinds of artifacts because of the
difference in frame rate (unless you're an expert at doing 3/2 pulldown for
a laserdisc company or something). 


  Hey, no fair! What about 'Fettucine' Alfredo Griffin? The guy practically
has to pivot the bat around along with his body. 


  Daulton doesn't strike me as all that strange. He's a little bit quiet at 
the plate but, like Franco, gets the bat through the hitting zone on a level
plane. The first time I watched Julio Franco, I didn't think *anyone* could
hit like that. Now I marvel at how easy he makes it look; every time he makes
contact, it's *solid*. He's got good power to all fields and rarely is he
caught not ready for a pitch. 

  I wonder if Phil Plantier had a severe bout with hemorrhoids and had to
practice his swing while 'on the throne'? :-) Sure looks like it :-) 

  How 'bout one to add to your list: Travis Fryman? The guy plants his front
foot and seems to swing *across* his body. He generates a lot of power, but
I keep thinking he could generate even more if he could get a better pivot
out of his hips. 


  Well, they're already spoken for (by several people), but .. 

  I'd add Robbie Alomar's name to the list, among others. I really like Dean
Palmer's swing, for some twisted reason, as well as Pedro Munoz's swing. 


  A thought about May: It looks like they've taught him to turn on the ball.
IMHO, he's going to fall in love with his newfound power and start pulling
off the ball to the point that he's going to see *lots* of sinkers/sliders
low and away. Unless he adjusts quickly and starts rifling doubles to left 
and left-center, IMHO you're going to see a good number of weak grounders to 
the right side of the infield in the next month.

Why not? I believe both the Devils and Islanders got 87 points.
Say for example, another team had this record : 20-37-47;
they had 20*2+47*1+37*0=87 which is the same as their points total.
(The Islanders' and Devils' records are both 40-37-7.

I'm confused.  How is it Hal McRae's fault that he can't win with a team 
whose best offensive player is Phil Hiatt?  I mean, let's be real.  Kansas
City will have to get outstanding years from their entire staff just to end
up near .500; they have less offense than any other team in baseball, even
if you count the expansion teams.

OK, you guys stirred up my childhood memories, so I went and did
some research on the final month or so of the 1964 season. It turns
out that my recollections were pretty darn accurate, at least as
far as the Phillies record goes. On September 1 1964 this was the
top of the N.L. standings:

                 W     L    GB
Philadelphia    79    51    -
Cincinnati      74    57    5 1/2
St. Louis       72    59    7 1/2
San Francisco   73    60    7 1/2

This is a game-by-game description of the remainder of the Phillies'
season:

Date  Score Opponent        Lead      Pitcher (starting and winner/loser)
9/1   4-3   Houston         5 1/2     Bunning (15-4)

9/20  3-2   Los Angeles     6 1/2     Bunning (18-5)
            (Reds move back into tie for 2nd with Cardinals)

Well so far so good for the Phillies. But now it all falls apart ...

9/21  0-1   Cincinnati      5 1/2     Mahaffey (12-9)
            (Reds take sole possesion of 2nd place)

            (Cards now 2 1/2 back in 3rd, Giants 3 1/2 in 4th)
9/26  4-6   Milwaukee         1/2     Mahaffey; Schantz (2-5)
9/27  8-14  Milwaukee      -1         Bunning (18-7)
            (Phils lose 7 1/2 games in 7 days; Reds take over 1st,
             Cardinals 1 1/2 back in 3rd)
9/28  1-5   St. Louis      -1 1/2     Short(17-9)
            (Cardinals take over 2nd place, Phils drop to 3rd)
9/29  2-4   St. Louis      -1 1/2     Bennett (12-14)
            (Reds and Cardinals now tied for 1st)
9/30  5-8   St. Louis      -2 1/2     Bunning (18-8)
            (Cardinals take 1/2 game lead over Reds)
10/1  4-3   Cincinnati     -1 1/2     Short; Roebuck (5-3)
            (Phillies halt 10-game losing streak; Cards lead Reds by 1/2 game)
10/2  Did not play; Cards lose to Mets, Reds tied for 1st, Phils 1 game back
10/3  10-0  Cincinnati     -1         Bunning (19-8)
            (Cards beat Mets, take first by 1 from Reds and Phillies)

Whew! what a finish! And the final standings were:

                 W     L    GB
St. Louis       93    69    -
Philadelphia    92    70    1
Cincinnati      92    70    1
San Francisco   90    72    3

Now it doesn't appear to me that Phillies pitchers Bunning and Short
were really overused, at least by the four-man rotation standard of
the day, until well along into the 10-game losing streak, at which
time Mauch was probably desperate for a win at any cost because the
Phillies substantial lead had evaporated. The way they were used at
that time may have made the problem worse, although Bunning had one
of his sharpest games of the year in the final day 10-0 shutout of
the Reds that cost the Reds a share of the pennant. Bunning pitched
a complete game six-hitter, striking out five and walking one. It
would be inetersting to see, though, how the total innings for the
year for Bunning and Short stacks up against the rest of the league.
Also notice that the Phillies played every day from at least September 1
through October 1; while they didn't play substantially more games than
the other teams, the other teams each had a couple days off during that
stretch.

I didn't mean to offend or anything, I'm just quoting Stanky himself on
the subject. I remember one time last year he was being interviewed by
ESPN, and the interviewer (can't remember who), asked Stanky if he was
Jewish because he (the interviewer) was Jewish and wanted to see more
Jewish ballplayers. To which Stanky replied, ""I'm Polish, not Jewish.""

So maybe that wasn't the most PC thing for Stanky to say, and maybe I was
a little naive when I posted it. I think we should just devote this
subject to finding actual Jewish ballplayers (I myself am Jewish and the
only ones I ever knew until now were Koufax, Greenberg, and Blomberg).",sports

Then allow me to enlighten you, Rex. You see, there's a thing called a tie. 
A tie is worth one point (I know, I know. You're not good at math. But bear
with me). A win is worth two points. So, getting two ties is the same as 
getting one win. If your team played two games, won one and lost one, you'd
have two points. If my team played two games and tied them both, we'd also
have two points. We'd be tied in the standings even though our records are
different.

"Just a few lines about my favorite team sweeping the Dodgers (one of 
my least favorite) in LA (Sweet!).  Also the Mets (my other least 
favorite team) loss to the Rockies made this this a great day and a 
great start to the weekend as the Cardinals are on the ESPN tonight.

Big Lee Smith is having a great start and the Cardinals seem to be
hitting in the clutch even though they have had a few games with lots
of hits and not many runs.  Hopefully with the coaches stress on
situational hitting in spring training, the runners LOB will be lower
this year (probably due to the high strikeout numbers by Jose and
Lankford and Zeile's off year).

I don't know why all the fuss about the Fillies.  The media and all the 
Filly fans on r.s.b forget who is right behind them in the standings.  
Give the Wild Thing a week or two before he starts blowing some games 
and we'll see who is in first then.  I believe the Cardinal pitching 
staff is more complete than the Filly staff and that will make the
difference.

On a side note, a few years ago (5-6), a comment was made by some 
baseball player or manager about the Dodger defense.  He was asked 
where to hit the ball against the Dodgers and he replied ""Fair.""  I 
remember it being in the ""They Said It"" section of Sports Illustrated.
I would like to know who said it and what issue it was in.

"I hope that this comes off as a somewhat unbiased assesment
of WFAN and WIP(I go to school in Philadelphia, and I listen to
both stations on a consistant basis.)  Now that the fan has Mike
Lupica on from 10 to noon, they have a person who can get the 
big name guests for interviews, and not just of local importance
He did have Dave Cheketts and Fred Wilpon on his show, but he 
had Bob Costas and Magic Johnson on too.  
  Now here are my opinions of the two stations competing talent:
Morning show:
  In my opinion, I think Imus is much better than Bruno, Cataldi, 
and Morganti, even though I would feel different if Morganti
had a better crew of people to work with.  To me, WIP tries
to copy Imus but make it all sports as a theme.  In terms of
sports, Imus lacks the blanketing of the airwaves, but he
interjects humor and politics into his show.
10 AM to 12 Noon:
  I think Chuck Cooperstein and Lupica are equal in their
abilities to host a radio show, but I think Chuck has the
advantage over Lupica in terms of dealing with the caller
who is asking about who the local team is going to draft
in the sixth round.  Lupica and the other hosts on FAN get
better interview guests, but I heard the PD of WIP say that
they were not interested in interviews with celebrities unless
it was a major story.
  I would consider this even because they are two different
styles of host.

12 Noon to 2 PM:
  At this point, I would have to give a big advantage to 
Jody McDonald over Len Berman because Lenny has only been
on for a couple of weeks.  I just think JM has the ability
to transcend the ""homer"" mentality of the Philadelphia fan
base.  This is most evident when the IGGLES(Philadelphia 
spelling) play the Cowboys because JM is a huge Dallas fan.
Where else can you have people call up and predict a 93-0
score without the egging of the hosts(re:WIP morning 'guys')
I do agree that JM was great on the FAN weekend overnight
and I miss hearing him over the current crop of rotating
hosts.  I feel that JM is the best sportstalk host on 
either station by a good margin.  If you are in NY and
you can't get WIP, JM does fill in on the weekends sometimes.

2PM to 4PM:
  This is the time when JM goes up against Francesa and 
Russo(fatso and froot loops) and I become the most divided
in my loyalties.  Mike and the dog are very entertaining,
but they often go an hour or so without calls or even 10
to 20 minutes without talking about sports.  MATD do
get great guests and that is the basis for their show, so
it is like the 10 to 12 debate.  Another plus is the
appearances by Mike and Chris on Imus in the Morning, which
are often hilarious.  

4 PM to 7 PM:
  MATD go up against Fredericks and Missanelli.  I like
Mike Missanelli but I just can't stomach Steve Fredericks.  
I know that SF came from Philly originally, but when he
was at the FAN, he was a NY homer as much as he is a Philly
homer now.  I don't listen to WIP much after 4 PM unless there
is a game on that night, but you will see later for the 
reason.  That is why I give the advantage to FAN.

7 PM to Midnight:
  S&M are on WIP until 8 and then it is the man who makes
Eli that calls MATD all the time seem like a novice on
charges of racism, G Cobb.  This man is so grating on my
nerves that if I listen to him for a few minutes I go
nuts.(I know that is biased, but listen to his show)
On FAN, there is usually a game on, Knicks, Rangers, Mets
Jets, or St. John's basketball.  If the game is on the
west coast, then it is usually Howie Rose.  Of course
I think dead air would be better than G Cobb on WIP, but
WIP does air Sixers and Flyers games during the season.
(If this is the sports station, why did they lose the
IGGLES to WYSP(home of Howard Stern in Phil.))
During the summer, it
is all talk on WIP.


Overall, I would have to give the advantage to WFAN, with
the exception of 10 to 12, and 2 to 4 where it is even, and
12 to 2 where WIP has the advantage.

Are you comparing Cullen to Salami?  I would say that that is valid.  If
Winnipeg is such a lousy defensive team then why the hell does Salami
stand around the other team's blueline when the puck is in his own end?



Excuse me?  Are the Jets playing .500 hockey?  Let me check...yes - but just
barely.  They have allowed more goals than they have scored.  Sounds an
awful lot like Salami's +/- to me.  Sounds like they would be just as well
off - or better - if he played the solid two-way game that our friends in
Finland claim he is capable of.  But if he did that he wouldn't be chal-
lenging for the league lead in goals would he?  The Bi-Planes might be
challenging for first however...


Now let's see...you have compared Timo to Anderson and Cullen.  Who's
next?  Mike Foligno?



Some of our Finnish friends who have watched him play claim that he
can play a solid two-way game.  I would have to say that this style
of contribution would be more conducive to winning.  Or don't you 
think so?



I don't believe it!  You did compare him to Foligno!  (And I honestly hadn't
read this far).

It would help if you used a little discrimination in your thinking.  Your
contributions would be more highly valued if we could see that you weren't
trying to be merely argumentative.

"Most of this discussion has been between Mark Singer and David Tate,
with Valentine weighing in on the same side as Dave at various times.
My opinion, FWIW, to all:

Mark, age doesn't matter; ability does. I would rather have the untried
rookie with great minor league numbers than the veteran who has proven
himself to be average at best. I don't care if he is 15; if he plays
better than what I have, I want him out there. Sandy Alomar had decent
minor league numbers, grossly inflated by the PCL in general and Las
Vegas in particular; he should have been projected as an average major
league hitter (which is good for a catcher, I'll admit). Santiago's
numbers would probably come out the same as Sandy's, but I don't have
the league data from the mid-80s to check it out.

That being said, I agree with sending Lopez to Richmond, at least to
start the season. As the box below shows, he has *one* minor league
season in which he hit well. He has two in which he hit very, very
poorly. I want to see that the 92 Lopez is real. Olson and Berryhill
are not complete mediocrities; for catchers, especially NL catchers,
they are essentially average hitters, with equivalent averages around
.220. If he had hit well at prior levels, I would say he belongs on
the Braves; but there is a reasonable chance that Lopez last year was
just as much a fluke as Alomar in 90 or Santiago in 87. One year at
any level, at any age, doesn't satisfy MY standards of evidence.

On a similar note, I don't understand why more people are not
supportive of Neon Deion. Granted, I thought his behavior with
McCarver last year was completely bush. Last year was the first time
he ever got 300 AB in one place, so his lines are hard to read. But he
has a combined 720 OPS in minor league play; with his speed is more
valuable than the OPS alone indicates; and at a still young age (24),
had a monster year with an 868 OPS. He has a total, major and minor,
EQA of .249; above major league average, and above average for CF
(which was about .240 in the NL last year). He has shown at least the
potential of going into the .290s, which would make him one of the 15
best hitters in the league. He has two full seasons before reaching
his ""prime"" season of 27. He should be considered as a legitimate
prospect, and not as a simple side-show attraction.

I have one complaint for the cameramen doing the Jersey-Pitt series:  Show
the shots, not the hits.  On more than one occassion the camera zoomed in
on a check along the boards while the puck was in the slot.  They panned
back to show the rebound.  Maybe Mom's camera people were a little more 
experienced.

     Depends on what you mean by classy. From what I've heard about
him, he was about as classy as Harold Ballard.  Only difference was
that back then almost all the owners were like that, so he seemed okay
by comparison.  Read the book ""Net Worth"" for one view of what Smythe
(and Norris and Adams and Campbell) were like. 



     Even more specifically, I think what Roger was saying (and I said
it previously too) is that these are NOT the people who made the
league great, so why should divisions, conferences etc. be named after
them instead of Morenz, Vezina, Howe, Orr etc., the people who DID
make it great.  Instead, the NHL has chosen to immortalize the men who

Cullen has gotten stronger since his return from injury a hand-full of
games ago and he played a good game.  If the other players on his line
can smarten up, that line should do okay.  Clark's got to get tough --
he's got to intimidate and go for the net.  Send Clark up the left

 Well, I'm a Wings fan and I think the FIRST thing that you should do is to
get the opponent's line combinations correct before you try to match up anyone
with them.  There is no Yzerman-Fedorov-Probert line, except for maybe on a
powerplay.  These three players usually play on three different lines.
Which would mean that Toronto's checking line would have to pull a triple
shift.
The Wings' lines usually look like this:
 
                      Gallant-Yzerman-Ciccarelli

"I've been a Giants season ticket holder for years and never really complained
about the old ballyard place. Sure, it's been cold, the food lines were long,
and the hired hands were surly, but this was all part of the Giants mystique.
Or so I thought.

I went to Tuesday's game (3 - 1 Giants over the Marlins) and the 'Stick was 
a much different place. Nothing short of a dome will eliminate the wind, but 
everything is a lot better. The lines are a lot shorter, the bathrooms are
CLEAN and have running water, and the hired hands were very polite. 

The new foghorn (lights up and blows after each homerun) and the wooden fence
are very nice, as are the new bleachers. The bleachers start right at the top
of the fence and give a great view, and they've got beer stands at the
bottome of the bleachers. The only complaint is that the electronic 
old-fashioned scoreboard looks electronic - could be better.

These things should have been done a long time ago, but it took a real 
businessman (ex - Safeway President Peter Magowan) to figure it out. Just 
like he used to tell his checkers, ""If the customers don't come back, I don't
need as many checkers"". This isn't a knock on Bob Lurie - he was a competent
businessman but he didn't deal much with the general public.

I'll give an example of how the level of service has changed. The onion 
dispenser jammed as I was using it. An attendant came over, apoligized for
the problem and proceeded to fix the machine. After he was done, he cleaned
the machine and said he was glad to be able to help. In the old days, there
was no attendant and the folks at the concession stands would say ""Go to

IMO, this expansion will not see the explosive jump in offense that the

In Gammons' defense, because the talent drain came from the AL as well, some

as examples last night, I noticed him elbowing Scott Stevens in the
head, which basically started the whole shoving match that got Stevens
(Scott) and Tocchet 2 minute minors. He also KICKED John McLean. Of
course he wasn't called for that. Isn't kicking an automatic match
penalty and 10 game suspension? I think Glenn Anderson got one a few
years ago for kicking Gaetan Duchesne in the chest. There's no doubt in
my mind that Barasso is the dirtiest golatender since Hextall. He's also
very good.

But why would you want to use RBI?   RBI is an attempt to measure is some

In terms of evaluating players, RBI totals are better than nothing.  But
why use them when so many better stats are out there?

Perhaps it was Trottier.  It happened behind the Habs goal if I recall.

a technical mistake is absolutely ludicrous.


Good for you.  You'd only be displaying your ignorance of course, but to 
each his own...


I think Gainey should feel honoured to know that he is remembered at 
all.


Certainly pluggers are an integral part of any team.  And that is
simply because there are not enough solid two-way players to go 
around.  Who would you rather have as your ""checking"" centre?  Doug
Gilmour or Doug Jarvis?  For that matter I would take either Gretzky
or Mario as my ""checking"" centres.  Do you think Gretzky could cover
Bob Gainey? 


You're wrong again.  The Selke is awarded to the forward that does the
best job defensively and this may or may not be the best plugger.  If 
Gilmour does the best defensive job in the league I don't see why he 
should be out of the running simply because he also contributes offen-
sively.

Settle down?  If you think that I have likened the Selke to the Nobel
prize then I suggest that you had best ""settle down"".  And if you are
going to try to put words in my mouth, let me suggest that you ""settle

-------------------------------------------------
Kings 6 @ Calgary Flames 3 - 04/18/93

The third place Kings opened the 1993 Stanley Cup Playoffs in Calgary, against
the second place Flames and came out with an impressive 6-3 victory in front of
a non-sellout crowd of 18,605 at the Saddledome in Calgary.

Symthe Division playoff hockey this was.  Both teams seemed a bit tense in the
opening period though the Kings scored off the opening face-off.  The Kings got
into the flow of the game much earlier than the Flames as they played out-
standing team defense.  It took the Flames 9:45 of the first period to record
their first shot on goal.  The Kings, ranked 16th of the 16 playoff teams on
penalty killing, shut down the Flames.  The Flames went 0-8 on the power play 
and could record only 8 shot on goal in those 8 opportunities.  The Kings had
their problems on the power play, yet they did manager to score 2 goals in 10
tries.

The Kings forwards back-checked while the defense stood the Flames up at the
blue line, allowing the Kings to take took the home ice advantage away from the 
Flames.  Rob Blake missed the game due to the lower back contusion but is ex-
pected to be in the lineup on Wednesday. Wayne Gretzky suffered a charlie horse
in his right leg.  He took a few shifts in the second period before retiring to 
the dressing room for the rest of the game.  Interviewed on the radio this 
morning, he stated that he was fine and would be in the lineup on Wednesday.

1st period: 
1-0. The Kings got things started right off the opening face-off.  Gretzky won
the draw with the puck going to Sydor.  He crossed center ice and slapped the
puck into the Flames zone and behind the net.  The puck carried around to the
far side where Robitaille wacked at it and the rebound bounced to Sandstrom. He
put the puck behind the Flames net where Gretzky picked it up.  Gretzky set up
in 'his office', moved to the near side and passed into the near circle where
Sydor had moved in.  Sydor, who got the puck between the face-off dot and the 
hash mark, shot off the pass, beating Vernon low and between the legs.

Millen and Fleury went off at 4:57.  Skrudland went off at 12:25 but the Kings
failed to convert.  Carson went off at 14:53 and the Flames failed to convert.
Dahlquist went off at 18:34 and Dahl went off at 19:30, giving the Kings a 30
second 5on3 which they failed to convert.  The Kings recorded 2 goal posts in
the period.

2nd period: 
The Kings opened with a 5on3 carried over from the 1st period which they failed
to convert on.  With 6 seconds left in the 5on4, Vernon put a bouncing puck into
the stands and received a delay of game.

1-1. Calgary evened the score on the ensuing Kings power play.  Kurri, with the
puck in the neutral zone, tried to put the puck into the Flames zone but it hit 
the stick of Fleury and bounced to Suter at the Flames blue line.  Suter skated 
down the near wing and into the Kings zone.  He faked a shot at the circle and
skated around Kurri. As he cut thorugh the crease, he got Hrudey to go with him 
and he put the puck behind Hrudey, on his stick side for a short hander.

2-1. The Kings reclaimed the lead 25 seconds later on the same power play.
Shuchuk, in the far circle passed to Sydor at the top of the slot and headed
for the net.  Sydors shot hit Shuchuk in the back and dropped into the low slot 
where 2 Kings (Shuchuk and Granato) were being checked by 3 Flames.  Carson
came from the far corner, picked up the loose puck and snapped a wrist shot
between the legs of Vernon from 5 feet above the crease.

3-1. The Kings widened their lead just 24 seconds later.  Rychel was checked off
the puck at the Flames blue line.  Taylor picked up the puck and sent a pass
cross the slot to Huddy.  Huddy shot off the pass, from the near face-off dot,
beating a diving Vernon on the glove side.

4-1. 2:59 later, the Kings had a 3 goal lead.  McSorley took a shot form the
near point that hit a Flame and deflected towards the boards.  Marty got his
own rebound, skated to the bottom of the circle and sent a pass into the low
slot that hit Dahlquist on the leg and deflected past the stick of Vernon.

Skrudland went off at 10:53 but the Kings could not convert.  Sydor went off at
12:35 and Watters went off at 14:40, giving the Flames a 5 second 5-3 but they
failed to convert.  McSorley went off at 17:19 and the Flames had 3 consecutive
power plays but the Flames killed it themselves when Suter went off for high
sticking at 17:31.  Sandstrom went off at 18:03 to close out the period.  The
Kings hit 3 goal post in the period.

3rd period:
The Kings used the phrase ""Initiate, not retaliate"" and it was very evident here
in the 3rd period as the Kings continued to pound the body and the Flames 
continued to take bad penalties to take themselves out of the game.

5-1. The Kings extended their lead to 4 goals at the 1:06 mark.  The Kings shot
the puck into the near corner of the Flames zone.  Vernon went behind the net to
cut off the puck but he could not control it.  Donnelly, who was behind him,
wacked at the puck, sending it into the low slot.  As Vernon slid back in to the
crease, Granato got a shot that hit a Flame and bounced to the left of the net
where Millen fired the rebound behind Vernon.

Sydor went off at 1:24; Nieuwendyk went off at 3:22 as the teams skated 4 on 4.

5-2. Otto, skating down the far side, stepped around McSorley, cut to the net
and passed to Dahlquist in the low slot.  Dahlquist cut through the top of the 
crease and put the puck in under a diving Hrudey.

Carson and Rychel came in on a 2-1.  When Carson passed across to Rychel, Fleury
tripped Rychel with no call.  The puck got shoveled into the far corner where 
Fleury knocked Rychel down and checked him from behind into the boards, drawing 
a 5-minute major and a game misconduct at the 6:08 mark.  Unfortunately, the 
Kings squandered the 5 minute power play when Granato (at 6:44) and Watters (at 
8:19) took penalties.  

5-3. The Flames closed to within 2 at the 8:47 mark.  MacInnis, at the near 
point, passed to Yawney at the far point.  He took a few strides towards the
net, wound up and drove a shot off the near post and in over the glove of
Hrudey.  The play started on another faceoff that the Kings lost.  Timeout - LA.

6-3. MacInnis took a penalty at 9:56 and the Kings converted on the power play
to seal the victory.  Sandstrom, skating down the far wing in the Flames zone 
cut towards the back of the net.  Just as he crossed the goal line, he passed 
the puck into the low slot, on the far side, to Carson who shot off the pass, 
beating Vernon on the ice, stick side.

At the 16:17 mark, Skrudland went off for slashing and Stern went crazy as he
went after Shuchuk.  Stern wound up with a double minor for roughing, a single
minor for cross checking and a 10 minute misconduct, and he took the Flames
right out of the game.

On the plus side:  The Kings, for the most part, played very disciplined hockey
as they let Calgary retaliate.  The Kings played good team defense and excellent
penalty killing.

On the minus side:  The Kings lost almost every face-off.  This must improve or
the Flames will surely get that power play back on track.

Notes:
------
The Kings recalled Guy Leveque, Brandy Semchuk and Jim Thomson from Phoenix.

Wayne Gretzkys 1st period assist was his 307th career playoff point.

The Kings entered the game 24th in the league in shots per game against, giving
the opposing team an average of 34.4 shots per game.

Flames goaltender Mike Vernon entered the game with a 3-9-1 record in afternoon 
games.  The Flames entered the game with a 34% success rate on the power play
over their last 9 games.

The teams were 3-3-1 against each other in the regular season.

"Here is a press release from the White House.

 Remarks by President Clinton to NCAA Division I Champion Hockey Team
April 19; Q&A Following
 To: National Desk
 Contact: White House Office of the Press Secretary, 202-456-2100

   WASHINGTON, April 19 -- Following is a transcript
of remarks by President Clinton to the University of Maine ""Black
Bears"" NCAA Division I hockey champions:

                           The Rose Garden

 9:58 A.M. EDT

     THE PRESIDENT:  Good morning ladies and gentlemen.  It's
an honor for me to welcome the University of Maine Black Bears, the
winner of the NCAA Division I hockey national championship to the
Rose Garden and the White House.  I understand from Senator Mitchell
that this is the first team from the University of Maine every to win
a national championship.  And we're glad to have them here.

     I'm inspired not only by how the team pulled together to
win the championship, but how the entire state pulled together to
cheer them onto victory.

     Coming from a state that is also relatively small in
size, but also filled with pride and tradition and community, I can
understand how the people of Maine must feel about the Black Bears.
In our state people are still talking about the time we won the
Orange Bowl over the number one ranked football team, and that was
back in 1978.  I'm sure that 15 years from now, the people of Maine
will as proud of this team as they are today.

     You know, in my state football is a slightly more
popular sport than hockey.  We don't have a lot of ice.  (Laughter.)
But after spending three months getting banged around in this town, I
can understand a little more about hockey than I did before I came
here.  Hockey is a tough game.  It's a hard-hitting sport.  It does
have one virtue though, there's a penalty for delay of game.  I wish
we had that rule in the Senate.  (Laughter.)

     In government as in hockey, leadership is important.  In
the United States Senate, our team has a great captain, the Majority
Leader and the senior Senator from Maine, George Mitchell; junior
Senator -- Cohen looks so young, I can't imagine.  (Laughter.)  I'm
actually bitter about Senator Cohen because he looks so much younger
than me.

     On your hockey team, the captain Jim Montgomery has done
a great job.  He scored the winning goal late in the championship
game, leading you to a come-from-behind victory -- something else I
know a little bit about.

     Sport brings out the best in individuals and in teams
and in communities.  I share the pride that Senator Mitchell and
Senator Cohen and Congressman Andrews and all the people of Maine
must feel for the Black Bears who have shown us all how to play as a
team, how to bring out the best in one another, and how to come from
behind.

     I think it's important, as I ask young people from
around America who have achieved outstanding things in working
together, to come here to the White House to be recognized and
appreciated by their country, to remember that those kinds of values
and those kinds of virtues need to be ingrained in all of us for all
of our lives.

     We now have another role model, and I'm glad to have
them here today.  (Applause.)

     (The President is presented with team jersey.)
(Applause.)

     THE PRESIDENT:  That's great.  I love it.  It's beautiful.
(Applause.)

     (The President is presented with an autographed stick.)

     THE PRESIDENT:  Thank you.  That's great.  (Applause.)

                             * * * * * *

     Q  Mr. President, did you authorize the move on Waco
this morning, sir?

     THE PRESIDENT:  I was aware of it.  I think the Attorney
General made the decision.  And I think I should refer all questions
to her and to the FBI.

     Q  Did you have any instructions for her as to how it
should be executed?

     THE PRESIDENT:  No, they made the tactical decisions.
That was their judgment, the FBI.

     Q  Is this a raid?

     THE PRESIDENT:  And I will -- I want to refer you to --
talk to the Attorney General and the FBI.  I knew it was going to be
done, but the decisions were entirely theirs, all the tactical
decisions.

     Q  What did you and Senator Mitchell talk about this
morning?

     Q  Any chance for that stimulus package?

     THE PRESIDENT:  Senator Mitchell ought to pay my
quarter.  (Laughter.)  I was in there -- (laughter).

     SENATOR MITCHELL:  You have to pay that quarter.

     THE PRESIDENT:  I was ready.  (Laughter.)  Senator
Mitchell, he's worth a quarter any day.

     Q  Any chance for your bill, sir?

     THE PRESIDENT:  We talked about what was going to happen
this week in the Senate and about what other meetings we're going to
have for the rest of the week.  We only had about five minutes to
talk.  And we agreed we'd get back together later, around noon, and
talk some more.

     Q  Senator Dole said over the weekend that your
compromise is no compromise.

     THE PRESIDENT:  Well, I know he did, but, look, Senator
Dole and a lot of the other Republicans now in the Senate voted for
the same kind of thing for Ronald Reagan in 1983; and our research
indicates that a majority of them over time voted for a total of 28
emergency spending measures totalling over $100 billion when Reagan
and Bush were President, in those administrations.  And many of those
purposes were not nearly as worthy as putting the American people
back to work.  I don't want to go back and revisit every one, but you


can do it.  You can look at the research there.  So this position
they're taking is not credible.  We have a very tough five-year
deficit reduction plan.  All these costs are covered during that time
and then some.  And the very people that are saying this has all got
to be paid for don't have much of a history on which to base their
position.  They've got 12 years of vote for stimulus measures of this
kind that had very little to with putting the American people back to
work.  So I think we've got a chance to work it out, and I'm hopeful.
We'll see what happens today and tomorrow.  I'm feeling pretty good
about it.

     THE PRESS:  Thank you

So in other words, if Roussel shuts out the Sharks and Soderstrom shuts out
the Penguins, that's immaterial because it was the coaches decision? Come on,
Joe, think about what you're saying! Who they played is VERY significant.
Why they played them is what's irrelevent. A low GAA against good teams
is better than a low GAA against bad teams in the context of comparing two
goaltenders. A low GAA is better then a higher GAA. A low GAA against good
teams is much, much better than a higher GAA against bad teams in the context
of comparing two goaltenders.


YES IT DOES! Absolutely. **In the context of comparing two goaltenders**.
Of course, at the end of the season 2 points is 2 points no matter how you
get them. And on the score sheets shutouts are shutouts. But if you're a
coach deciding between two goalies, or a GM looking to make a trade, you
have got to look deeper than the stat sheets. I didn't see the second Toronto
game, but the first one was a defensive masterpiece. There was nothing in
that game to judge Tommy Soderstrom on because he wasn't tested. The same
for Roussel in the Ranger game. Two real scoring chances, one he made a
great play, the other he was saved by a mistake from the other player. If
you were judging Roussel on that game alone, you have very little to go by.

But if you were to look at the 0-0 tie against the Habs, you saw a goalie
stand on his head to get that shutout. THAT was a #1 goalie in action. Roussel
doesn't have a game like that in him.


Don't be so sure of that. FLYERS management never says bad thing about
Roussel, but they don't say too much on the good side either. I've seen
at least two interviews where every time Farwell was asked how happy he was
to have two good goaltenders, it was Tommy this, Tommy that, and oh, yeah,
Dom has played well too.


FLYERS in the NHL Hall of Fame. Kinda dull, really. They handed out a
team picture to everybody who walked in from Pizza Hut, but it was the
same picture they sold in the programs in mid-season. Had names like Benning,
Kasper...


Mostly random seat locations, some were given out by having certain
autographs on the team photos. I don't like that method since I've seen
guards help out people get things like Lindros pictures, surely if they
got their hands on an autographed picture they'd hold 'em for their buddies.",sports

The tater that Jack Morris served to Griffey the Younger in his first
at-bat this year went 394 feet, if I remember right (I'll have to check
my scorecard at home).  I think that's the longest so far in the Kingdome
through the first stand (five games) there.  A weak showing, despite some
promising taterball candidates ... Ben McDonald, Rich DeLucia, and the
rest of the Mariner bullpen ... making appearances.

 Granted, Gilmour should get the Hart Trophy, NOT Lemieux... Just
Look at what Gilmour did for Toronto.  When you think of Toronto,

n Gilmour?

Back to Detroit...  There really isn't a team that could stand up
to them if all the players on the team play to their potential,
no one could stop them.  Yzerman, Fedorov, Coffey, Lindstrom...
there's more firepower there than Pittsburgh... and they don't tri

"

And some comments, with some players deleted.


Yep, that Kevin Mitchell.  I never would have expected him in the
#1 spot.

It's no accident that the first two names are 1988 only.  As with first
and second base, 1988 was the year of the glove.  Average DA was 20 points
higher in both leagues than any other year.

Looks good.  Too bad he's moving to short.

Highest five-year regular, though he's only had one year as good as Kevin
Mitchell :->.

The other elite fielders in the league.

This is an interesting line.  His 1988 figure was slightly below average.
His 1990 was pathetic, and his 1991 was the next best year by anybody.  Part of
that may be his mobility.  1988 was with the Yankees.  1990 was with the
Padres, who appear to have a rotten infield.  1991 was with the Twins, and
judging by Leius and Gaetti, the Metrodome may be a good place to play
third.

Add another to the elite fielders list.

Too fielders whose career average may overstate their value.  I don't know
what happened to Caminiti -- judging by the three previous years, his low
1992 may be a fluke.  Sabo is merely average, however.  His incredible 1988
(best year ever) brings his average up a lot.

Strange last two years.

According to reputation, one of the best fielders ever at third base.
But at the end, he was below average.  (Average in 1988 was .643).

Boggs has been pretty good.  I don't know what happened in 1990, but every
other year he has been above average, usually by quite a bit.

Last year -- a fluke or a portent?

Why is it that the two leagues usually have defensive averages very close
to one another, but very different from year to year?  Any ideas?

Brook  is declining.

Three first-time regulars, above average in 1992.  I'm not sure why Jefferies
gets all the grief about his fielding.  He's never had a good year, but while
at second he improved to become an average fielder, and is an average fielder
at third.

Zeile, on the other hand, is a below average fielder.  Each year he's about
10 points below average.  And it's probably not just the park, since Terry
Pendleton had excellent DAs in the three years before this.

Moving back to second was a good idea.

So why is Hayes supposed to be good defensively?  He's had a grand total
of one year above the league DA, and was pretty bad last year.

Howard Johnson and Carney Lansford -- separated at birth.  To his credit,
HoJo did have one above average year (1990).  Lansford couldn't even break
the .600 mark without the help of the year of the glove.

Good hitter, but his fielding needs work.

Not a good fielder.

Both are better off at shortstop.

Two consecutive horrible years for Leo.  Camden Yards doesn't seem to
have helped his fielding any.  

Texas slugger debuts with not only the lowest career DA, but the lowest
DA at third ever.  Congratulations, Dean.

Before I begin lambasting Don Cherry, let me first say that I've been sort of
a Cherry fan for a while...admittedly stuff he says has to be taken lightly,
but he's more-or-less harmless.  On Saturday, however, he crossed the lines of
good taste:


This is the best he can do?!!  Gee Don, tremendous amounts of professionalism
here.  The CBC looks just as bad as he looks foolish letting him get away with
this nonsense...making fun of names??  It's bad enough that he makes asinine
blanket statements about European players, but he's now resorted to making fun
of their names too?  He sounded like an idiot, much like he did last week
when he said that Teemu would never make it to his 'Rock 'em, Sock 'em' video
until he dropped the gloves...


Well, what he _said_ was that even though he's been around the league for quite
some time, he still doesn't know who's where w.r.t. conference and division
names.  HELLO??!! McFly??  The names have been around for a couple of decades
or so....he also invited the audience to ""Name the teams in the Wales...quick,
quick!"" Followed by ""Ah, you don't know, I don't know....""  

Sorry Don.  Wrong on this one.


This was absolutely hilarious.

Don's argument about the basketball and baseball brawls was fairly
good...unfortunately he neglected to mention the fines that were levelled in
the NBA case.  Serious money...oh well, he's never been one for objectivity,
has he?

We're probably stuck, as Mike Burger pointed out that the baseball
deal was made far in advance of the NHL contract.  WABC did the same
thing; they were thankful that the Devils were wiped out by 9:30,
because they had to switch over to Yankees baseball.  The proof of 
the reasons for this is left to the reader ...

It's too bad, but I wonder if ESPN is stuck with other US local team
coverage for their alternate games?  We got NESN's coverage of the
Bruins-Sabres with the Boston homers ... they were awful!!!  I've read
that Derek Sanderson is the colour analyst ... I wonder if he spent
his early years after hockey as an intern at PRAVDA before landing
this job?  *Everything* had to be twisted into something good to say
about the Bruin(s) involved ... not even Bill Wirtz's shills on SC
Chicago (Pat Foley, Dale Tallon) were this bad.  And just to be fair,
SC used to take their feed from ESN (Empire Sports Network), the Sabre
homers and they were horrible too ... but they were spacy.

From the CNN highlights, I hear Chris Cuthbert's voice from the CBC
coverage of the Habs-Nords series.  Too bad that we couldn't get it
on ESPN, with all due respect to the Sabres and the Bruins.

Mike Emrick is substituting on the Devils SCNY team for Gary Thorne.
Mike was the original Devils TV play-by-play announcer, by the way.

Geez, Dal must have slipped something into Ted's drink sometime.  Comparing
Prince to Pagnozzi offensively is laughable.  Prince has never hit well in
the minors and he's now 27 years old, I think.  Pagnozzi was not a bad hitter
in the minors.  (I'll bring in the numbers tomorrow assuming I don't have
another brain cramp and forget.)  He had a very good year at Louisville 
before coming up to the majors.  As I recall, the hype on Pagnozzi coming up
in the organization was good hit, decent fielding.  When he got to the 
majors and didn't hit as well as expected (not as much playing time?), he 
became Exhibit 312 in Nichols' Law of Catcher Defense and got the reputation 
as an outstanding defensive catcher.  It's not clear he ever learned to
hit.  His four years with more than 100 AB--

Born 31 July 1962
Year     AB      BA     SLG     OBA  
1988    195    .282    .320    .328
1990    220    .277    .373    .321
1991    459    .264    .351    .317
1992    485    .249    .359    .290 

No power, less-than-league-average walks, peak year when he turned 28, 
now declining.  If Ted is going to invoke Pagnozzi as a model for Prince,
given that Prince has underperformed Pagnozzi in the minors, it's not
a rosy picture.

BTW, I'm still unhappy with moving Zeile, who had the same reputation 
coming up in the Cardinal organization as Pagnozzi, except that he was
a much, much better hitter, to 3rd where he could be an average hitter
and a below average fielder instead of a well-above average hitter
as an average (or below average) fielding catcher.

  Or you may be posting this WAY TOO EARLY and be eating your words by
  mid-season. C'mon, the Phillies haven't proved anything yet. Atlanta
  was similar to the Phils 2 years ago. They sucked. They started having
  a good year, but didn't get any respect until they actually won the
  division. (which is how it should be) So until the Phils AT LEAST   
  have a good year, not just a good 2 weeks, they won't get any respect
  either. BTW, Atlanta's .188 BA is actually a compliment to how good
  the Braves really are. Their record is 6-3. Can you imagine the Phils
  record if they were batting .188? hahahaha. And Atlanta's hitting will
  improve dramatically.  
  No, I'm not a Braves fan. Just defending a good team.

No, Caleb, it's not the quality of ESPN that I have a problem with;
it is superb, whereas it did not evolve beyond the point where ESPN
left off when hockey went to SC (this is excepting SC's use of feeds
from CBC (-;).  It's the amount of hockey they're showing, or lack
of it, that we're complaining about.  They had rights to two OT's
that could've been shown on Sunday night after baseball ... and
they had pickup trucks racing through oversized pigpens followed
by Super-8 home movies of old car races (yes, I was checking in
desperation for Canucks-Jets) last night after SportsCenter.

Do you mean Juan Berenguer?  He was traded for Mark Davis in the middle
of last season.  Exchanged one stiff for another, as Berenguer hadn't
come back from his injury in 91.  I think he's retired now.

Anyhow, as middle relief, Marvin ain't that bad.  He at least can
pitch a couple of innings or do mop-up work.  I don't know much
about McMichael (was he the Mexican League guy?), but
everybody else in the pen is a 1 inning man, except maybe
Mercker.

Of course a run scored is just as important as a run prevented.
Just as a penny saved is a penny earned.  Enough with the cliches.
My point is that IF the Braves starters are able to live up to
their potential, they won't need much offensive support.
I realize this is a BIG IF.  This staff leaves the '92 BoSox in the dust.
There is no legitimate comparison.  Two Cy Young winners, and three other
pitchers that most any team in the league would kill to have as their first
or second starter.  It seems to me that when quality pitchers take the
mound, the other teams score less runs.  The team that scores the most 
runs wins.  This puts the team with the better pitching at the advantage
(providing they can stop the opposing team from scoring runs).  A low 
scoring game would clearly benefit the Braves.  They should have many 
low scoring games due to their excellent pitching and below average hitting.
On the flip side, if you had a starting lineup of great offensive players,
I would be arguing that this team would not need great pitchers.
They would have an advantage because they could simply outscore their
opponent.  The name of the games is to win.  Even Ray Knight knows that
you do this by putting more runs up on the scoreboard.
All I'm trying to say is that if you assemble the quality pitchers
like the Braves have, the offense doesn't need to be as strong.

"Here is a review of some of the off-ice things that have
affected the AHL this year.


ST JOHN'S MAPLE LEAFS PROBLEMS
The St John's Maple Leafs sophomore season has been plagued by
problems. On-ice, the Leafs won the Atlantic Division title but
off ice was less happy. A strike by public workers has forced the
leafs out of the Newfoundland city for much of the last half of
the seaosn (since mid-Jan). They have played ""home"" games in places
like Montreal, Cornwall and Charlottetown. Their playoff ""home""
games will be played in the Metro Center in Halifax, NS. One
demostration got violent. Workers attacked a Leafs' bus and
rocked it and broke windows in the St John's Memorial Stadium.
Despite the problems, Toronto officials insist that the Leafs
will return to St John's once the strike ends.
===================================================
SENATORS SOLD
The New Haven Senators have been sold by Peter Shipman to
the Ottawa Senators NHL organization. They are the only Canadian
NHL team with an American AHL affiliate, and have made it clear
they intend to move the team to somewhere in the Canadian Atlantic
Provinces. This sale and move has yet to be approved by the AHL
head office, but is expected to pass easily at the general meeting
in May. The quote in the story from Jack Butterfield made it 
clear the league was more interested in the stability of the 
AHL franchise accompanied by NHL ownership, rather than maintaining
the 56-year history of the AHL in New Haven. 

The Senators are currently in serious negotiations with Charlottetown
New Brunswick and are expected to move there.
==================================================
DALLAS HELPS HAWKS STAY IN MONCTON
After announcing that they would pull their affiliation out
of Moncton, the Winnipeg Jets changed their mind. 

The Jets announced the move when they said that they would be slashing
their minor league roster from 20-something to around a dozen; and they
wanted to share with an existing AHL or IHL franchise.

Enter the Dallas Lone Stars. Dallas agreed to supply the remaining
6 or 8 players to the Moncton franchise. Thus keeping the Hawks
in the New Brunswick city.

The deal is for one year and will be extended to three years if
the season ticket base increases to over 3000. The Hawks only sold
1400 for this year.
============================================================
SAINT JOHN FLAMES OFFICIAL
The Calgary Flames have officially signed a deal with the city of
Saint John, NB. The Saint John Blue Flames will play in the 6200
Exhibition Center. The Flames still have to apply for an expansion
frnachise from the AHL but are expected to have no trouble.
=========================================================
CAPS FOLLOW JACKS TO MAINE
Despite rumors to the contrary, the Capitals will follow the Baltimore
Skipjacks to Maine. The Caps' current farm team, the Baltimore Skipjacks,
announced that they would move to Maine and become the Portland Pirates.
There was much doubt as to if the Caps would follow but they announced
a limited deal with Portland. They would supply a dozen or so players
including 2 goalies. They become the third team to announce a limited
farm team along with Moncton and the Capital District Islanders.
======================================================
AHL GAME OF THE WEEK
In early January, the AHL started a game of the week. The game, produced
by, I believe, Pyman Productions, was televised across the Canadian
Maritimes and northeastern US. The first few weeks saw two games of
the week, one in Canada and another in the US but since then, there
has been only one. Sunday afternoon and night games were covered and
shown on Sportschannel NY and NE in the US and, I believe, Atlantic
Sports Network in Canada (but I'm not sure about that). I am not
sure if playoff games will be covered.
=====================================================
UTICA GONE? SYRACUSE ADDED?
There were heavy rumors that the Utica Devils will not be around next
season. There were rumors that they might be headed to a midwestern
city and that the city of Syracuse is trying to lure them.

"In the mist of the Rangers soap box (i.e. Captain neMesis-ier/ex-coach 
Roger Nebula bad blood bath) and with high hopes turned to new coach 
Mr. Klean (Commissar Keenan)... I would like to know what procedures 
hockey teams use to select their captains (including A's). Are they 
selected by the coaching staff, do the players vote for a captain, or 
are they appointed by management?

And, while we are on the subject, has a captain ever been traded, 
resigned, or been striped of his title during the season? Any other 
team captain trivia would be appreciated.",sports

This is incorrect.  This year the Pens had 61 games on ""free"" TV and 6
games on PPV.  Next year they will have 62 games on free TV and 22 on 
a subscription basis.  

You actually get 1 more free game than last year, and there will be no
more ""radio-only"" games.

Its a good deal.  Last year, everybody bitched about Baldwin ""breaking
up the team"".  Now, he goes out of his way to keep the nucleus of this
team together and that takes money.  He comes up with a creative way
to generate more revenue so he can afford this team, and people bitch
some more.

Everybody wants something for nothing.

"One ""t"" in ""Eddie Mathews""!
Because a small advantage in fielding ability comes nowhere near
making up for the large difference in hitting.  Their average
seasons, using their combined average 656 (AB + BB) per 162 games:

         Years  AB  H  R  2B 3B HR RBI TB  BB  AVG  OBP  SLG  OPS
Santo    14.10 577 160 81 26  5 24  94 268 79 .277 .366 .464 .830
Robinson 17.55 607 162 70 27  4 15  77 243 49 .267 .325 .401 .726

Fielding, we have, per 162 games at third,

         Years   P    A   DP   E   PCT
Santo    13.15  149  348  30  24  .954
Robinson 17.72  152  350  35  15  .971

Even if Robinson's extra 3 putouts, 2 assists, and 5 DPs are taken to mean
he was responsible for 10 more outs in the field, that doesn't make up
for the extra 28 outs he made at the plate, not to mention the fewer
total bases.  The difference of .104 in OPS should be decreased by about
.025 to account for Wrigley, but a .079 difference is still considerable.
The Thorn & Palmer ratings are

           Adjusted      Adjusted    Stolen   Fielding  Total
           Production  Batting Runs Base Runs   Runs    Rating
Santo         123          284        -14       137      41.7
Robinson      105           52         -5       151      19.8 (26.3)
Usual disclaimers about T&P's FR apply, but they really shouldn't be
way off the mark in this comparison.  At least it's better than fielding
percentage: Carney Lansford has a .966 , 10th best all-time, but -225 FR,
dead last of all time.  Also, since this total rating compares players
to league average instead of replacement level, Robinson should be
awarded an extra 6.5 or so for playing 653 more games.  He had a great
career, but I would prefer Santo's plus 4 years of a replacement level 3Bman.

But I would knock Traynor off the list and replace him by Stan Hack.
That's a similar story, Hack's far better hitting outweighs Traynor's
superior fielding.  Graig Nettles and Buddy Bell would also be better
choices (IMHO of course, though some recent net discussion supports
this point of view.)

Shouldn't that be right field?

I *loved* Dan Kelly!  He was on USA when I first got hooked on Hockey back
in 1980 or so.  No, he wasn't always spot on top of the play, and he
wasn't overly cute, but those pipes!  That lusty, barrel chested, voice!
No pipsqueak was he (unlike some fellas we know!)

I rode into hockey mania on the coattails of Gretzky and the Boys on the
Bus.  My first Finals saw the Islanders sweep them.  But I'll never
forget the night, a year later, when the Oilers closed it out at home in
the pandemonium, the smoke from a million sparklers, the long empty-net
goal near the end, and Dan Kelly letting the crowd's reaction tell the
story for a few long seconds, then that voice barking through the din
""Dave Lumley ... sews it up for Edmonton!""  It sounds stupid, but that
early (for me) hockey memory will always bring a thrill.  Since then
I've grown a lot more jaded about the game, but I was really saddened
by Dan Kelly's passing.  He was one of the good guys.",sports
"I'm no Kingman fan.  Just thought I'd point out that he's the

I don't think Reggie's WS game counts, else I believe he would

Ted, you're missing a vital point.  As Roger Lustig pointed out in a
previous response, the reason why Schott was banned from baseball was
because she had been known to call and think in a racially biased manner on
a constant basis.  Such thoughts affected her hiring practices.  Bonilla,
on the other hand, was found to have mentioned this one word a single time.
 If he had been known to go around, criticizing homosexuals, it would be a
different story.  Furthermore, he is merely an athlete.  He doesn't have to
hire anyone as Schott had to do.  Dave Pallone, the former NL umpire who is
an admitted homosexual, has decided to assist in a protest before a Mets
game at Shea.  He, like you, thinks that Bonilla should be suspended from
baseball.  Pallone is hoping for a year's suspension.  In my opinion,
that's downright ludicrous.  As Howie Rose on WFAN said, if you start
suspending athletes who have mentioned a derogatory word even a single time
under whatever conditions, then you'd probably have enough people remaining
to play a three-on-three game.  Now, honestly, if you truly analyze the
differences between the two cases that you bring up in your article, I
would think that you'd reconsider your thoughts.

"I have been to all 3 Isles/Caps tilts at the Crap Centre this year, all Isles
wins and there is no justification for Vukota and Pilon to play for the Isles.
Vukota is absolutely the worst puck handler in the world!! He couldn't hit a
bull in the ass with a banjo!! Al must remember a few years back when Mick 
scored 3 goals in one period against the Caps in a 5-3 Isles win. I was there
and was astonished as was the rest of the crowd. Wake-up Al!!! Years later he's
gotten worse. He's a cheap shot artist and always ends up getting
stupid/senseless penalties. I think he would make a good police officier!!!

As for Pilon, he can't carry the puck out to center ice by himself. He either
makes a bad pass resulting in a turnover, or he attempts to bring the puck 
towards the neutral zone and skates right into an opposing skater. He can't
stay on his skates with most forwards or centers. He either falls down or 
committs a penalty. Call up somebody from Capital District AL!!!!!

As far as the playoffs, the Isles are as difficult to figure out as the Caps.
Two good teams with talent but so inconsistent. They should meet in the first
round. The Isles seem to play up to the level of their competition so they
should play well against Jersey tonite. It'll probably be another tight 1-goal
game as the last 20 games hve been for the Isles. I wish when the get a lead
they could continue to pour it on instead of settling back into a defensive
shell and letting the opposition get back in the game. Al MUST understand he
can't do with this team what he did with the 80-83 Isles. maybe Al should got
to. Where is Bobby Nystrom?? Clark Gilles?? John Tonelli?? These are the kind
of young minds we need behing the bench!!    FIRE AL!!!!

crease or even on the bench for the Stanley Cup playoffs does not sit well with
the rookie goaltender.

""I want to be a part of the team at the most crucial time of the year, the most
fun time of the year, and I'm not,""  Stauber said with some emotion Monday.  ""I
think I have worked hard enough for that.""

Stauber said he accepts Melrose's choice of Kelly Hrudey as the teams top goalie
in their playoff series with the Calgary Flames. Hrudey made 21 saves in Sundays
6-3 opening victory.

But Stauber clearly is upset with his sudden status as the No. 3 man behind Rick
Knickle.  Stauber had a 4-1-2 record and 2.98 goals-against average down the
stretch in the regular season and nearly wrestled the No. 1 job from Hrudey.

Knickle?  He won 2 of 3 decisions but had a bloated 5.26 average, twice was 
yanked from games (once for stomach cramps) and hasn't played since March 29.

Yet, when the series resumes Wednesday, Knickle will serve as Hrudey's backup
again and Stauber will have to satisfy his playoff hunger by munching on Olympic
Saddledome popcorn.

""If I'm supposedly close to being the starter or could have been the starter...I
dropped too. 3.  What happened to No. 2?""  Stauber wondered.  ""Not that I'd be
happy with No. 2, but I feel I should at least be a part of this team in the
playoffs.""

Perhaps Stauber eventually will get his chance, but Melrose apparently is not
convinced the 25-year old is capable of handling playoff pressure.

While insisting he is the Kings' ""goalie of the future,"" Melrose said Stauber
flubbed all four of the big games he was asked to win this season.  They were,
according to Melrose: a 7-2 loss to San Jose on Dec. 26; An 8-3 loss to the New
York Rangers on Jan. 23; a 6-6 tie with Detroit on Feb. 11; an 8-6 loss to 
Vancouver on Thursday.

""Four times this season Robb could have emerged as the elite goalie, he could
have taken it away from Kelly Hrudey, and he didn't do it,"" Melrose said.  ""An
elite goaltender has to carry the ball when you give it to him.  The mark of a
great goalie is that he isn't satisfied to be a backup.""

""I'm not blaming Robb for the losses, but if you're going to be No. 1, you've
got to be able to walk your talk.  You've got to be able to play when everything
is on the line.  Robb Stauber has a great deal of ability, but maybe I expect
more from him than he does.""

Ouch.  That remark stung Stauber.  He began the season 9-0-1, struggled when the
team hit a mid-season slump, didn't play for a month after Knickle was signed
off the San Diego Gulls roster, then came on at the end.

""I expect more from myself than anybody, including Barry Melrose,"" said Stauber,
a three-year star at the University of Minnesota who left school in 1989, only 
to have his development hampered by a string of serious injuries.

""What I've been through the last four years - two knee operations, a herniated
disk in my back, shoulder surgery - what more can I go through?  I obviously do
expect a lot from myself, otherwise I wouldn't be here.""

""Anybody who would disagree with that doesn't know me.  I'm not saying Barry 
doesn't know me, but don't say I've been without expectations.  If anything, I'm
a perfectionist.""

Stauber acknowledged he played poorly in the four games Melrose mentioned. ""But 
even though I didn't play well, I get knocked down from maybe on to three? It's 
a bit of a jump,"" he said.  ""You're almost No. 1, or if you play a good game 
you're No. 1 and if you don't you're No. 3?  Why does Jack Nicklaus shoot a 67 
and then a 75?  Can you explain that?  That's what barry wanted me to explain 
to him, why I didn't come through when he counted on me.  I don't know. What I 
do know is, it's a sport.  I'll be there.""

Melrose's ""goalie of the future"" statement doesn't mean much to Stauber. ""Before
you know it, I'll be 30 and there will be no future,"" he said.

The first time I heard this piece of news was on the post game radio
interview here in Jyvaskyla. That was the bronze medal game in the 
SM-liiga which Tichonov's team Porin Assat (the Aces of town Pori:)
lost.  Vasili, the son of Victor Tichonov (the famous Soviet coach),
said that for a long time the Sharks have been persuading him to
take the assistant coach post. But he wants to be the head coach where
ever he goes. He definitely won't be coaching Assat anymore (after
three? seasons). I don't know why.

Vasili is a good coach I believe. Assat was a good team, produced many
players to our national team. Assat wasn't a skilled team (IMHO) but
they had the fighting spirit. After all, they butchered Jokerit in the
playoffs and gave hard time to TPS, the champs. But Assat wasn't
consistent, only when they were in the right mood they could beat any
team in the SM-liiga.

I am not 100% sure about the deal with the Sharks. As I said, he wants
to be the head coach. But he and the Sharks are going to negotiate and
decide during the WC. I doubt that he will be the head coach but
maybe they'll do some compromise.",sports

Unfortunately, you seem to lack the ability to rate players.  Dave
Winfield has had a better career than half the people in the Hall of
Fame.  Eddie Murray and Darrel Evans are both one of the top 100 players
of all time.  Lee Smith has had probably the greatest long career
of any relief pitcher since 1960, with the possible exception of Gossage.

On the other hand, Kingman probably isn't one of the best 750 players
of all time.

And Reardon, though a good pitcher, isn't in Smith's class career wise.



We're talking 2 of the top 50 players of all time here.  There probably
aren't 5 shortstops in history who were better than these two.


Garvey sucked.  Morris, while a very good pitcher, simply doesn't
belong near Cooperstown.

 Gee, can these guys even compare to

If Puckett and Ryan (okay, no if there) get into to the Hall, they will be 
marginal Hall of Famers (unless Puckett keeps hitting like he did last year for
a while longer)

To put this in perspective, here's a listing of the linear weights
values of the careers of the players you mention.  In parenthesis
is how high they are up on the greatest ever list if they make it.
While no one would claim these are perfect rankings, they should give
you a good value of these guys' careers as compared to average players.

Robin Yount 43.0 (41)
Ozzie Smith 42.1 (45)
Dave Winfield 40.3 (53)
Eddie Murray 37.5 (68)
Darrel Evans 35.2 (80)
Kirby Puckett 24.3 (180)
Nolan Ryan 21.6 (219)
Jack Morris 11.8 (478)
Dave Kingman 0.4 
Steve Garvey -5.8

To give you an idea of how these numbers compare to those in the Hall:
Of the 71 eligible players whose career stats equaled 35.0, 64 are in the Hall
of Fame. The ones who aren't include 4 19th century players, Ron Santo, Bobby
Grich, and Bob Johnson.

Of those eligible who score between 30.0 and 34.9, 15 of 25 are in.  Of
those eligible who score between 25.0 and 29.9, 24 of 44 are in.

In most cases, the owners have very little to do with it.  They give their
general managers one order when it comes to the draft...find me the best
players so that our team will win the Stanley Cup.  Whether that player is
in Kindersley, Saskatchewan or Chelyabinsk, Russia, if the GM believes him
to be the better player, the GM should be drafting him.

Where do you get off calling the NHL THEIR league, when referring to Canadian
players.  It doesn't belong to them, it belongs to the owners.  The owners
can do what they want.  While a 'Canadian content' rule might be enforcable
here in Canada, there is enough doubt that it would be enforcable in the US
that the CFL (sorry for the football reference) didn't even TRY to push their
import ratio rule on the Sacromento Goldminers.

Increasing the competition for the 'elite' positions, in most cases, would
make players better anyways.  (Oh yeah, and how many Europeans play at the
lower levels of professional hockey in North America?  While there are some
that play in the AHL, or the IHL where that's an NHL team's primary farm
club, you don't hear of many Europeans playing in the CHL, the ECHL, or on
the secondary farm teams in the IHL.  (ie. the Jets do have a few Russian
players in Moncton, but I don't believe there are any Europeans in Ft. Wayne.))
So with all those teams, there are plenty of positions for hockey players
in North America.


I'm in favour of the NHL being the league for the premier players in the
world.  I've grown up with Europeans playing on 'my' team, and some of those
players were the among the best in the world.  From Hedberg, Nilsson, and
Sjoberg, to Sel{nne, Zhamnov, and Olausson, and all those in between and to
come, I wouldn't have it any other way.",sports
"

I tend to agree that players are not hurt by early play in the big leagues.
The BRaves organization is a fertile ground to test this hypothesis, as they
had little talent on their roster for some time.  Steve Avery, for example,
was rushed to the majors, and he fared very poorly during his initial campaign.
His subsequent pitching has not been affected by his 5+ ERA during his rookie
year.  Bill James pointed out that it was relatively unusual to struggle so
and then rebound.

Bob Horner was also rushed to the majors (out of Arizona State directly) had
good numbers immediately.

I am not certain of the ages of people like Pete Smith, Craig McMurty, and
Derek Lilliquist.  The Braves pitching staffs were so bad when they came up
that they might have been rushed.  Lilliquist and Smith struggled, but it
didn't hurt PS and DL may have been overhyped.  I seem to recall CM pitching
well initially, though I don't have stats handy.",sports

It's not a cliche, and (unlike your comments below) it's not a tautology.
It needn't have been true.  If every pitcher in baseball were essentially
the same in quality (i.e. if the variance of pitching ability were much
smaller than the variance of batting ability), then scoring runs would be
much more important than preventing them, simply because the *ability* to
actively prevent runs would be much weaker.


If that's your point, you should have said so.  What you in fact said was
""Pitching and defense win championships"", and later ""Pitching is the essence
of baseball"".  Neither of which says what you are now claiming was ""your 
point"", and neither of which is true.


And you accuse Sherri of mouthing cliches!?


It's not clear to me at all that this is true.  In high-scoring games, the
team with the better offense wins a high percentage of the time.  In low-
scoring games, the split is essentially 50/50 regardless of team ability.


I thought you said ""pitching and defense win championships"" and ""pitching is

The Selke candidate forwards main purpose on a shift is to prevent goals
from being scored- not to score them.  When Lemieux or Gilmour play their

why they are not Selke candidates.

Gainey is the best defensive forward ever.  I stand by that assessment.
He was a very good player who belongs in the hall of fame.  Did you
ever watch him play? He never made a technical error.

I've never seen a game where one player has committed 5
penalties.  Something like this would require more attention by
the referee.


But you're creating a scoring opportunity where there might not
have been one before.  I can see the relationship between free
throws awarded after a certain number of fouls, but it's
obviously easier to score in basketball, there are more
opportunities.  If a basketball team scores 100 points, that's
at least fifty chances made.  The average number of shots taken
by each team in a hockey game (and this is a total guess) is
probably around 40, and a team is lucky to capitalize on maybe
5 of them.  You have some good ideas concerning the other
penalties, but I think that a player should be awarded a
penalty shot only when they had a chance to score and was
interfered with.

Also, later in the post, you talked about how boring the NBA
game you attended was, that play was stopped too often.

 Hmmm...what about walks and SB? Baerga got clobbered by Alomar in OBP and
beat him in SLG by a lesser margin. Even putting aside any other factors,
a player with a 51 point edge in OBP is more productive than a player with
a 28 point edge in SLG. The issue has been studied before, and I doubt you
could come up with any convincing argument the other way.
 People see the batting average and the HR, but they don't really know  
their value is worth unless they've studied the issue closely. The fact is that
Baerga ate up a LOT more outs than Alomar; while Baerga was making outs,

I think you missed one of my points there.  It takes *more* than a great
GM to win a stanley cup, even once.  Some of the guys on the list you
gave earlier never won one.  I agree that you and I could probably argue
back and forth for days to no avail about who is the best GM in hockey-
that is a matter of opinion, and who is to say my opinion is any better 
than yours or yours than mine?  But the point of my *original* original
post (if not well stated) was that Murray has the GM abilities but not
the coaching abilities.  Which leads to below:


I think at this point there's a personal, emotional element involved here
which transcends Murray's logical thought.  As outsiders, it's fine for 
us to say, ""He should hire a different coach.""  In fact, he has talked about
doing so in the past.  But, the press (here in Detroit, at least) has so
built up this business about Murray never getting past the second round of
the playoffs as a coach, that I think he has taken it upon himself to 
prove to the world that he *is* capable of coaching a team past the second

So it becomes a matter not of intelligence, but of pride.  Is it foolish
to let pride stand in the way of sound logic?  Perhaps, but we're all
a little that way from time to time.  I think eventually he'll step down
from behind the bench and concentrate on his GM duties, and the team will
improve as a result.

I think his coaching duties take away time he might have otherwise spent
on GM work.  In that sense, once he steps down as coach, we'll see how
good of a GM he really is.

*suck*, but most batters hit *better* in this situation.

Alomar?  He hit .354/.439/.517 with runners in scoring position!

The difference?  Alomar had 68 RBIs in 147 such AB.  Baerga had 81

20% more times.

twice the hitter that Shields is. Then the next batter was Jose Vizcaino, one

"Was going over some videos last night.....

Studying 1986 and 1992 videotapes of Jose Canseco proved to be very
interesting.  And enlightening.

Here's my analysis of Jose Canseco, circa Sep '92, and Jose Canseco,
circa June 1986.

1.  He's bulked up too much.  Period.  He needs to LOSE about 20 pounds,
    not gain more bulk.

2.  His bat speed has absolutely VANISHED.  Conservatively, I'd say he's
    lost 4%-7% of his bat speed, and that's a HUGE amount of speed.

3.  That open stance is KILLING him.   Note that he acts sort of like
    Brian Downing - way open to start, then closes up as ball is
    released.  Downing could do this without significant head movement -
    Canseco can't.  Also, note that Canseco doesn't always close his
    stance the same way - sometimes, his hips are open, sometimes,
    they're fully closed.  Without a good starting point, it's hard
    to make adjustments in your swing.

What would I do, if I were Jose?

Aside from salting away a large sum of a cash that I could never touch,
so that I'd never have to work again, I'd restructure my entire swing.

First, minimize movement before the swing.  Close and widen the stance,
and severely cut down the stride I take on my swing.  Hopefully, this
will cut down on the time I need to swing, and will allow me to move
the bathead more freely.

Second, drop 20 pounds.  Cut out the weight work.

Third, relax the wrists.  Will cost some power, but until I can find
my 1988 stroke, concentrate on keeping the back shoulder up, rolling
the wrists through the strike zone, and hit line drives.  His strength
 is more than enough so that some of those line drives will get out of
the park.

If Canseco's open stance and resulting bad habits are a result of his back
problems, he'll be out of baseball in three years.  If not, he could
still hit 600+ HR.

lethargic that year until he arrived slide into overdrive.  The
Oilers missed him more the following year than Kurri, and I think

I agree and disagree.  John is saying that the batters efforts will result
in 4 more wins then losses.  While you are probably correct that 400%
does not mean 4 more wins then losses, it means something.  I would
rather have a player who increased my teams chances of winning by 1% in
each of 400 PAs then I would a player who increased my chances of winning
by .5% in each of 400 PAs.  Thus, there appears to me to be an obvious
positive association between John's statistic and winning games.  Thus,
before you disregard this stat, it appears to me that further study must
go into what sort of relationship there is.


The only problem here is an insistance that these number mean exactly
how many wins the team has.  First, we are using averages over many
seasons and applying them to one game.  Second, remember some players
performance take away from the chance of you winning.  That is a
player who gets an out gets a ""negative probability"" in most cases.
Thus, I'm not sure in any given game when you add up all the numbers
for a team who won that they will add up to 1 in that game.  Sometimes,
they will add up to more then one sometime, less than one.  Also,
the pitchers' bad performances (giving up 6 runs) may have given
them a large negative percentage for that game.  Also, any batter that
pulled an 0-4 night would give large negatives.  




No, but really only because you have a smaller sample size.  I would
think however, that the number of runs you score in the first inning
would be just as good as a prediction as how many runs you score 
in the last inning.  And, realize something else a closer usually
comes in in a close situation, not a blow out.  It is hard to argue
that any runs that a closer gives up in a game have equal importance
to those given up in the first inning.  Look, a closer giving up runs
often means a team will lose many games.  On, the other hand a starter
who gives up runs often still leaves his team a chance to win.  The
offence has many more outs to do something about.  But, I am not
saying all late inning situations are equally important either.  If
I am down 8 runs in the ninth, it really does not matter how many
runs my pitcher gives up in the ninth.       



No, but why would you assume that the teams probability of winning would
be 0 before the possesion in which the free throws were made.  Look,
if you are down 1 point with 5 seconds left, there is a fairly high
probability that you will win the game if you are in possesion of the
ball.  And, do not forget that somebody elses missed shots, turnovers,
fouls, bad defense, etc. caused a ""negative chance"" that the team
would win.
 
From reading all of the discussion on this statistic, I feel that those
who critisize it to a certain extent are doing so out of an agenda.
At first look this statistic valadates clutchness.  But, it really
does not.  Cluthness revolves around the idea that certain players
in crucial situation elevate their performance and others performance
goes down.  I've never seen convincing proof that this really happens.
So, if you assume there is no clutchness, then that means that except
for a lot of noice, this statistic has a positive association to
player performance.  There is a way to get rid of the noice if you
do not believe in clutchness.  Certainly, we could find out what
the average value of a home run is for example.  We may find for
instance, that a home run increases your chance of winning by 15%
on average while a strikeout decreases your chance of winning by 5%.
I bet if this were done we would find that this statistic was just
as good as other statistics we have for predicting wins and losses.

How do we evaluate relief pitchers?  Say John and Sam have the
exact same pitching statistics (runs, earned runs, K's, BB's,
etc.)  Both had exceptional numbers.  John, however only pitched
in closer situations, while Sam was a Mop up man.  Who was more
valuble to their team?  Probably John.  Who was the better 
pitcher?  They were probably about the same.",sports

"By Dave Luecking Of The Post-Dispatch Staff

At 9:11 Thursday night, the scoreboard watchers at The Arena began to cheer.
Their cheer quickly turned into a roar, and finally, the sellout crowd of
17,816 rose as one to rock the old barn at 5700 Oakland Avenue in a salute to
the playoff-bound Blues.

The scoreboard had just flashed the news from Detroit -- Red Wings 5, Stars 3.
With the North Stars' loss, the Blues officially clinched fourth place and the
final playoff spot in the Norris Division. Good thing, because the Blues quit
playing.

They held a 5-1 lead over Tampa Bay when the Detroit-Minnesota final appeared
with 3 minutes 52 remaining in the second period. They promptly went to sleep
and barely held on for a 6-5 victory that nearly slipped away at the buzzer.
Tampa's Bob Beers tipped in a pass from Shawn Chambers, but officiating
supervisor John D'Amico and video goal judge Rich Schweigler ruled that the
shot had gone into the net after time had expired.

``I'm glad I didn't see it go in at the end,"" Blues coach Bob Berry said.

If the goal had counted, he'd have been more upset than he was by the Blues'
disappearance in the final 24 minutes. Holding on for the victory and making
the playoffs tempered Berry's anger.

``It wasn't pretty at the end,"" he said. ``We played 36, 37 great minutes, as
good as we played all year. It slipped away at the end. It shouldn't have, but
it did.""

Still, the Blues won, prompting another ovation from the crowd at game's end.
Despite their shoddy effort in the third period and all the turmoil this
season, the Blues still made the playoffs. They'll meet the Chicago Blackhawks
in a best-of-seven Norris Division semifinal, beginning at noon Sunday at
Chicago Stadium.

The Blues finished the regular-season with a record of 37-36-11 for 85 points,
their fourth consecutive plus-.500 season. Minnesota finished three points
behind in fifth place, with a record of 36-38- 10 for 82 points. Tampa Bay,
which played spoiler last week by tying the Blues 2-2 at Tampa, ended its
first season with a record of 23-54-7 for 53 points.

The poor finish cast an unnecessary shadow over what should have been a joyous
Blues locker room. Instead, the mood was one of relief and some disappointment.

``It's a shame we let down,"" said Kevin Miller, one of three Blues to score
two goals. Brendan Shanahan and Bob Bassen were the others.
``There was no need for a letdown. If we'd have kept working, it would have
ended 6-2 and everyone would be happy.""

Instead, a lot of players were happy just to make the playoffs.
``We won, and that's all that matters,"" said Brett Hull, scoreless and minus-3
for the night. ``Once we got up 4-0, it was really tough to play.""

Some players didn't have a problem.

``Just because the score was announced, our line didn't quit,"" said Rich
Sutter, who played with Bassen and Miller. ``We still had a game to play. You
can't allow five goals like we did, that's not right.

``It was disappointing to see what was going on.""

Bassen was almost frantic on the bench because of the Blues' effort. Somehow,
he missed the announcement of Minnesota's loss.

``I didn't know it was final,"" he said. ``I was kind of looking around on the
bench. I didn't realize it was a final for some reason. We're in the playoffs,
and that's great, but it's a little disappointing to play like we did at the
end.""

The letdown was precisely the reason that Berry had instructed the scoreboard
operators to keep the Minnesota-Detroit score off of the board. The score
showed 0-0 until it first popped up with Detroit leading 4-2 in the third
period. The Blues already led 4-0 at the time.

``I told them I didn't want to see the score, I didn't want to know the score,""
Berry said. ``I felt we had to win the game, and that's the approach we took.""

If Minnesota took a lead, Berry feared, the pressure of having to win might
bother the Blues. If Detroit led, he worried, the Blues might quit.

Until the announcement, the Blues played splendidly. Shanahan got the crowd
going at 10:44 of the first period, scoring his 50th of the season. Then,
Miller and Bassen took charge late in the period.

With the teams playing four on four, Miller broke in on left wing, deked
defenseman Roman Hamrlik and beat former Blues goalie Pat Jablonski with the
rebound of his own shot with 21.6 seconds remaining in the period.

Then, just 10.5 seconds later, Bassen rifled a long slap shot past Jablonski
after defenseman Rick Zombo intercepted a Tampa pass in the neutral zone.

Bassen made it 4-0 just 14 seconds into the second period, scoring on the 
rebound of Bret Hedican's shot. The goal gave him his first two-goal game of
the season and reminded him of a special friend.

Last year, Bassen befriended young Oliver Mulvihill, who died of a rare form
of cancer at age 6 on Feb. 23.

``I was thinking of my buddy Oliver,"" Bassen said. ``He's in heaven now, and
I know he was watching. I know he's happy.""

Miller increased the Blues lead to 5-0 on a break-away goal set up by Zombo
at 11:09. Then, Steve Maltais broke Curtis Joseph's shutout just 18 seconds
later, making it 5-1.

Less than a minute after the North Stars' final was announced, Tim Bergland
scored and cut the lead to 5-2. But Shanahan scored his 51st, converting a pass
from Nelson Emerson with 21.3 seconds remaining in the  second period.

Then, it was all Lightning. Adam Creighton scored 40 seconds into the third
period, prompting Berry to rest the overworked Joseph. Guy Hebert allowed goals
to Shawn Chambers and Danton Cole in a span of 1:21 midway through the third
period.

The goals by Chambers and Cole made Shanahan's second goal stand up as the
winner. ``We were in there,"" Shanahan said. ``The game was over. We were in.""",sports

   >

     Actually, what I think has become more evident, is that you are determined to
     flaunt your ignorance at all cost.  Jagr did not have a better season than
     Francis ... to suggest otherwise is an insult to those with a modicum of
     hockey knowledge.  Save your almost maniacal devotion to the almighty
     plus/minus ... it is the most misleading hockey stat available.

     Until the NHL publishes a more useful quantifiable statistic including ice
     time per game and some measure of its ""quality"" (i.e., is the player put out
     in key situations like protecting a lead late in the game; is he matched up
     against the other team's top one or two lines; short-handed, etc), I would
     much rather see the +/- disappear altogether instead of having its dubious
     merits trumpeted by those with little understanding of its implications.

Thank you for posting this.  As the person who first brought up the
fact that Jagr has a much higher +/- than Francis, I can assure you
that I brought it up as an example of the absurdity of +/-
comparisons, even on the same team.  I never, ever thought that anyone
would argue that Jagr's higher +/- actually reflected better two-way
play.

In my opinion, Francis's low +/- is purely a result of him being asked
to play against opponents top scorers at all times; the fact that he
can chip in 100 points while neutralizing the other team's top center
is a testament to how valuable he is, even if his +/- suffers.  On the
other hand, Jagr, for how big, fast and skilled he is, can't even get
90 points, no matter how inflated his +/- is.

(By the way, don't get me wrong -- I like Jagr.  He may be a lazy
floater, but he turns it on at exactly the right times -- like
overtime of playoff games).

"Well, the tentative rules, anyway.  And, of course, since the season is
not entirely over, tentative entry form.  But who cares?  The real hockey
season is starting!!!!!

Here's the deal:  You email (preferably) or post your predictions, AND the
number of games you think each series will go.  Each round will be
weighted, so that the Stanley Cup finals will be very important, but the
early rounds will still be important.  Here is the scoring:

Pick 1st round winner, way off on games:  2 points
Pick 1st round winner, within one game:   3 points
Pick 1st round winner, pick # of games:   5 points

Pick 2nd round winner, way off on games:  3 points
Pick 2nd round winner, within one game:   4 points
Pick 2nd round winner, pick # of games:   6 points

Pick conference champ, way off on games:  5 points
Pick conference champ, within one game:   6 points
Pick conference champ, pick # of games:   9 points

Pick Stanley Cup champ, way off on games: 8 points
Pick Stanley Cup champ, within one game:  10 points
Pick Stanley Cup champ, pick # of games:  14 points
Pick loser in 7, series goes 7:           2 points
Pick loser in 7, series decided in Game 7, OT: 4 points
(these last two are sympathy points, probably won't happen anyway)

Obviously, picking the Stanley Cup champion is important.  I will do some
tests to see if the format is fair, but probably I will be too lazy to
modify it, so the scoring will probably be like this.  As for entry forms,
well, this post is getting too long, so see next post.

Um, what?  Eddie Murray was a superb first baseman for a *long* time.

Winfield as produced consistently for almsot 20 years, and excellently
on several occasions.  

Dave Kingman's *best* year was like Darryl Strawberry's *typical*
year with the Mets.  

Darrell Evans, too, did a whole lot more than just hit homers, which 
*is* all that Kong did.  



Whom are you talking about?  Yes, Eddie Murray is marginal, but that's
because he's 38 years old.  He wasn't marginal for a *long* time.



Not.  

Smith has hung around for a long time AND fielded the position better 
than anyone else ever has.

Yount stopped being a shortstop about a decade ago, in case you hadn't 
noticed.

One of his two MVP awards was as a centerfielder.



Like whom?  There are many players in the Hall who aren't anywhere near
as goos as the guys you're running down.


That's already the case, by some standards.  But the *bad* players in the 
Hall are all from the 20's and 30's.  Recent picks have generally been
excellent.


No, but who cares?  Was Stan Musial anywhere near as good as Babe Ruth?
Not really.  But he obviously belongs there.

The Hall has generally had about the top 1% of major leaguers.  As 
more players come through the game, more will be in that top 1%.  

And, yes, it's pretty easy to argue that Smith,. Yount, Evans, Winfield,
etc. are in the top 1%.  Dave Kingman on the other hand, was a liability
throughout most of his career.

Of course, Garvey *hasn't* gotten a lot of HOF press, so I don't know
what you mean.  

As for Ryan, is his W-L better than Morris'?  That's what a lot of voters
tend to look at.  And Morris *was* awfully good for a decade, and doesn't

<In response to a debate about who has has a better season- Jagr of Francis>

I think Jagr did he probably had a better point per minute ice time- stats
don't exist to properly analyze this and he had a substancially better +/-.



+/- is a useful statistic.  If a player is on the ice when his team scores a
lot of goals and only allows a few goals, he must be doing something right.
It is especially useful to compare between teammates- as they play for the
same team and should have roughly similar +/- ratings if they are equally
good players.  It can be adjusted- with varying degrees of success to compare
between players on different teams.

I agree it would be nice for the NHL to keep more statistics- but how useful
are the ones that you suggest??  Total ice time would be very useful- it is
a missing stat in Jagr vs Francis arguments from before.  Somehow measuring
the quality of ice time as you suggest would be useless.  It would be a
better stat for evaluating coaching- ie are the players given quality ice
time actually their talented ones?  A very good player could be given low
amounts of quality ice time because of team depth or a stupid coach who
doesn't recognize his talent and a very bad player could be given lots of
quality ice time because of a lack of team depth or a stupid coach that
thinks he is an effective player.  This stat would be much more flawed than
+/- and almost no conclusions could be drawn regarding player talent.

+/- is a useful stat.  It is quite useful in evaluating player talent.
You are the one displaying ignorance because of your unwillingness to see
that being on the ice when goals are scored but not when they are allowed
is a very positive thing- and should be evaluated as such.",sports
"
I don't buy this at all. Roy was the reason the game was tied... and that
would *not* have been the case had Dionne kept his cool. 
Hextall gave up 2 very questionable goals himself ...
Both Dionne's and Bellows' shots were misplayed by Hextall, but just because
his gaffes were early in the game, no one seems to care. Roy stood on his head 
for the first 15 minutes of the game when the Nords were rushing from 
end-to-end. Kamensky's mini-break after the tying goal and the first shot by 
Young in OT were both excellent chances stopped by Roy. Roy outplayed Hextall 
for most of the game, but Roy becomes the villain and Hextall the hero 
because Roy's team didn't make full use of their opportunities.

Hextall, on the other hand, had a lot of lucky bounces ... he played very 
well, but the Haller shot off the post in OT, the rebound bouncing over 
Bellows' stick, the Brunet breakaway, the 3 chances for LeClair ... all 
those opportunities were *not* finished off by Montreal, and it cost them.
Hextall wasn't particularly brilliant on those plays ... 


Sure, no excuse ... but it was just the 1 goal. The timing stank, but against
an explosive team like Quebec, they gave them 1 opportunity too many with
a powerplay that was totally unnecessary.


I disagree. Roy played well because he wasn't screened the whole night. 
The defense, for the 1st time this season, played remarkably, keeping Sakic,
Nolan, and Sundin  out of the slot most of the night.


This most certainly was a team loss... Leclair missed his opportunities,
as did Bellows and Brunet. Dionne took a bad penalty. Damphousse and Lebeau
were *silent*. Carbonneau and Savard were a step behind all night. Roy gave
up the bad goal. Roy, by no means, can be singled out for this loss.


And Hextall didn't on Dionne's goal? Please. Roy is paid big money because
that is his value compared to other goalies ... and he still is in the top 5,
when you consider the defense, or lack of one, that played in front of him
for most of the season.


The Montreal media is the quickest to heap praise and then hurl derogatory
comments against the Habs. They are no better than uninformed fans. Why should
they read the papers? They played 58 minutes of ""Burnsian"" hockey to shut
down Quebec. All they need tonight, and for the rest of the series is the 
extra 2.

Red Light to face Quebec...rubbish. That's a guaranteed way to end the
series 4-0. Who would be taught a lesson by this ?
The fans, the media, and Racicot, perhaps. Certainly not the rest of the team.


If you mean the goal should never have gone in, because there should never
have been an OT, then I agree. But the goal itself was a great piece of work
by Young. Roy had both the near and far posts covered, but Young flipped the
puck up under Roy's arm as he wrapped-around the net ... not a bad goal at all.",sports
": I think Dean got hit by a pitched ball the other night... he got pinch hit for
: and didn't play against Baltimore tonight... whats up with that? Is he hurt?
: Please tell me he's not...

He evidentally got hit in the elbow by a Fernando pitch.  His arm swelled
from the elbow to the wrist (or something like that).  They took X-rays
of the arm and there is nothing damaged.  He missed the last game with the
Orioles, but he is suppose to be ready for the next game.

Hope this helps.",sports

several names--SORRY!)  This week, it's time for the greatest PEAK players.

 1) Who cares?


I hope there are some surprises here: Raines above Muisial?  Carter above
 Bench?  Ripken above Banks?  Bonds above Mays?
Check the numbers of each player in comparison to the numbers of the rest
of the players that year(s), and you'll see that I'm fairly close with
this ranking system (which is primarily based on Total Player Rating) for
four consecutive years.",sports
"

Interesting! One of our German friends here (Robert?) told me their forwards
were all Canadian-Germans. Perhaps somebody can sort this out for us?
 

OK, ""this ain't North America"" and so on, but I still doubt that _any_ city
having a pop. of 500,000 and below could support an NHL team. Of course,
Switzerland probably should be judged as one large city because of small
distances between cities but still. 


Dusseldorf? YES, although the arena is an anachronism (an OPEN wall behind one
of the goals - essentially an outdoor arena!). Cologne's arena only seats about
7,000-8,000, Berlin is about 6,000 and no new facility will be built
unless their Olympic bid is successful. Munich does have an arena. 


Malmo is big enough, but they also need a new arena...the current one has 
5,000 seats I think.


If we're talking about the NHL, even Helsinki would struggle to make it work.
Turku (despite an excellent arena) and Tampere are nowhere near big enough for
major league hockey.


...Rome and the south are out of the question; this could as well be Africa
to hockey fans. Romans were given the chance to host some WC'94 games but
showed no interest whatsoever. All teams in the Italian league come from Milan
and the smaller cities in the north.


Paris had their own ""Volans Francais""(sp) pro team a couple of years ago.
I believe they even made it to the European Club Championship finals 
tournament one year, but eventually folded due to lower-than-hoped-for 
attendances. The remaining cities seem to be too small to support a minor 
sport like hockey.


The easter cities lack the money and infrastructure to support pro hockey.


Perhaps . . . Most European teams will have to be like the Tampa Bay Lightning
anyway; playing in a small 10,000 seat arena, backed by Japanese money, run by 
enthusiasts (Phil Esposito), heavy
marketing, fans that have difficulty telling what ""icing"" means... London has
been mentioned, Sheffield and Birmingham also have large arenas and a new
mega-facility (16,000 seats!) might be built in Bristol in a couple of years.


No facilities to speak of; their biggest arena (in Eindhoven) seats 2,500 
fans for hockey. ",sports

"To those who are wondering what is happening in Minnesota:

  From what I have seen in the local news (TV and newspaper), various people 
in the area are trying to get a new hockey team.  A columnist for the St. 
Paul ""Pioneer Press"" wrote an article giving the ""inside scoop"" on the 
issue.  There are three local sites competing for a team and three possible 
candiates to move to the Twin Cities.  First the sites: Target Center, Civic 
Center (St. Paul), and yes, even the Met Center.  The columnist was pretty 
confident that Minnesota will get a team, and that the Target Center will 
ultimately win out.  He argued, however, that the competition from the other 
two sites will delay the process considerably.  Without the 
inter-site competition, the columnist (sorry, I can't remember his name) 
believes that Minnesota would have a team by the 1994-95 season.  Also, 
because of the situation with the Timberwolves, things will be delayed 
until (unless) the city of Minneapolis takes over the Target Center.  
However, they are unlikely to do so until the Met Center is destroyed, 
because the city will lose money if there is competition from the Met for 
conventions and short-term events (even with hockey at Target).  To add to 
this mess, a STUDY (6 to 12 months) is going to be conducted on the future 
viability of the Met Center, which obviously delays the process even 
further.  I hope that the study is cancelled, which will have the effect of 
knocking the Met Center out of the running and perhaps encouraging 
Minneapolis to take over the Target Center sooner. The city would be
be even more encourged if the wrecking ball is taken to the Met, 
which may happen.
	Regarding possible candidates, the three teams are 
Hartford, Tampa Bay, and New Jersey.  I would prefer the Devils (Minnesota ""
Ice Demons?"") although the Lightning may have potential.  Although it hasn't 
been announced yet, it looks like 6 neutral site games will be played at the 
Target Center next year.  Apparently the Devils are interested in playing in 
as many of those six games as possible, and I wouldn't be surprised to see 
Hartford and Tampa show up there either.	So, Minnesota may end up 
getting another team, but it may take a few years.

	
	Go Sabres!",sports

I think the three-headed GM's guiding principle was to keep veterans
in favor of youngsters only if they offered a ""significant"" advantage.
At the end of last season, the contracts of several veterans with somewhat
maginal contributions (Fenton, Bozek, Anderson, and a couple others I
can't remember) were bought out. The idea was that youngsters could
play almost as well, and had the potential to improve where these
older guys did not. 
And they traded Mullen, because he wanted to go, not because he
wasn't good enough, but I think they were a bit too optimistic
in thinking they could make up for his contributions.
An example from this season, Skriko was brought in on a trial basis
but not kept, because of his age. I thought he was a decent
contributor worth keeping around.

The youth movement has its advantages; look at Gaudreau who
might still be in KC if more veterans had been kept around. But
you have to find the right balance.",sports

"Here is a summary of Don Cherry's coach's corner from April 18, 1993.
It took place in the first intermission of game 1 of the Montreal-Quebec
series. 

Pre-game comments
-----------------
Don's pregame comments were mostly aimed at the goalies... The goalie
who gets back his all-star form (Roy or Hextall) can win the series
for his team.

Eposode Summary
---------------
This episode took place rinkside. Don was holding a hot dog that
he bought from the concession stand.

Ron Maclean started out by showing a cartoon which appeared in the
Toronto Sun. It featured a picture of Don, who just saw his shadow
and proclaimed ""Will you look at dat, eh? Means another 6 weeks
of me. Beauty.""

Next, Don talked about the hot dog he was holding. According to
him, the hot dogs at the Quebec stadium are the best food in all
the arenas in the NHL.

From there, Don commented on the Quebec-Montreal game. The game
had great flow, because Referee Paul Stewart calls the best game
in the NHL. In contrast, the Calgary-LA game was terrible... All
stop-and-go, over 50 minutes of penalties called against Calgary
by Dan Marouelli. Its getting so that the ref who calls the most
penalties gets to ref in the finals.

Next, Ron showed an old picture of Don, when he was playing for
the Rochester Americans of the AHL. Don recalled some of the
wins that he had in the Quebec arena... during the Memorial cup
and the AHL championships.

Finally, Don and Ron discussed Keenan becoming coach of the
Rangers. The rangers were a talented team who underachieved.
Don feels sorry for temporary coach Ron Smith, who had
several key injuries (to Leetch and Patrick) and goalies who
went cold.

Don had some criticism for the Rangers team... The party's over,
Adolf (Keenan) is there. The Rangers organization will no longer
be a 'country club'.... ""NY should be achamed of themselves... If
they go in the tank with Adolf there, they'll be hanging from the
yardarm by their thumbs.""


Rating

Nothing too special in this episode.

I'll give it a 5.5 out of 10.

Pocklington just wanted to wake up the powers that be holding political
office, in Northlands, and in the business community that the Oilers
with their current lease arrangement are in a state where on a yearly
basis they will likely have an operating loss based on ""normal"" hockey
revenues and expenses.  That he did this was a good thing...it is better
he complain early, and make the city aware of a potential looming crisis
before he begins to lose millions and millions of dollars...which would
truly jeopardize the franchise.

Pocklington's first option is not to sell or to move, but to sell
a minority share of the team (to realize some of the appreciated value
of the team) and to get a better arena deal, either in Northlands, or
via a new building.  Pocklington probably isn't going to get exactly
what he wants...but ultimately he will probably get enough, or will
sell to someone who will probably get enough.

There are a lot of risks in moving a team also...

: Of course, penalties will have to be changed:
: 
: Roughing:	Chauvanistic Males Being Aggressive
: Slashing:	Chauvanistic Males Venting Frustration
: Fighting:	Proof That Males Cannot Cope With Their Feelings
: 

NO NO NO! since all the penalties fall into three classes, there should
only be three penalties:

1. Foul (Any illegal contact with the other player or his stick with your
   body or stick). If you get 5 you are out for the game.

2. Unsportsmanlike contact. (An intentional foul). This inlcludes all the
   current flavours of roughing, fighting and boarding. If you get two you
   are thrown out of the game, and fined.

3. Technical foul. Bad mouthing the ref, by player or coach. Penalty shot
   is awarded. Two and you are thrown out of the game.

Besides the penalty shot for one technical, if the team gets 5 penalties
in a period, the opposing team gets a penalty shot for every additional one,
until the end of the period. The victim gets two shots if he/she was in
the act of shooting when the foul ocured.

This works well for several reasons. First, penalty shots are the most
exciting thing in hockey, right? So, it follows that the more the better.
Next, when the player is setting up for a penalty shot, the network can
take a commercial. Finally, with only three penalties, the network
announcers (Don Meredith, Dick Vitale, John Madden, Pat Summerall, and
Marv Levy, among others) will be able to tell the viewers what happened before
the PA announcer says it.

Oh, one other rule. When a goal is scored (10-20 times a period), the play
cannot resume until the PA announcer announces it. This way, the network
can sneak in a few more commercials. Then, once the PA announcer has told
them who scored, the TV announcer can tell you the viewer, and even have a 
chance of pronouncing his name right.

Seriously, though, I actually went to see a NBA basketball game last week,
for the first time in my life. I was amazed how boring it was. The play is
so slow they actually had fans come out for things like free-throw shooting
contests DURING THE PERIOD!. Of course the 'Laker Girls' get to do their 
routines at least 6-8 times during the game, and not just between periods
either. There is a whistle every 30 seconds on average, maybe less. The
game is 48 minutes, with 2 minutes between quarters 1-2 and 3-4 and a
10 minute halftime, and it still takes over 2 hours.

The reason for this has to be TV. There is plenty of room to throw in
commercials, and have the announcer jabber while nothing else is happening.
On TV, basketball is fairly entertaining, IMHO. But, it is better to watch
it on TV than to be there. If this is the road the NHL is following, then
it truly is a sad day.

Enough for now.",sports
"Dave Winfield's name does not go



       In terms of PEAK, and I repeat PEAK years, Winfield has Done it  
all. He has batted in the 340's for a season, drove in 100 and more runs  
many times in a row before his injury. Consistently hit at or near 300  
while knocking in 35 home runs. Have you even LOOKED at Dave Winfield's  
slugging percentage for three or 4 of his best seasons. I still think that  
dave was one of the BETTER of all time, but obviously not the best. He was  
one of the best athletes evr to play baseball. He hit line drives that hit  
the scoreboard in left-center field, a feat np one has done in the new  
Stadium. Heck, only 2 or 3 other people have hit it over that green fence  
since it has been remodeled. He could field, had a bullet arm, and his  
hitting was comparable in many seasons to gary sheffields, and barry bonds  
of last season. He is older now, and slowing down, takes more of an  
uppercut to lift the ball out of the park, but he will always be my hero,  
and my idol. There is nothing that could make me happier than George  
inviting Dave back to the Bronx to play his last year of ball with the  
Yankees. Of course, he will most likely refuse the offer, but who knows?  
For 3 million dollars, he'll play. Heck they are giving gallego 2.5  
million this year, having Dave as their DH, while leaving him time to play  
the field when Tartabull is injured, or Nokes and mass are traded, should  
give the Yanks the inspiration and leadership that will sweep in a new age  
of Yankee domination.

Golly, I love stupid people. :-)
Listen, Rex, this is hockey.  The NHL, to be precise.  And in the NHL,
there exist these things called ""ties"".  A tie occurs when a game ends
with the score for each team equal.  Each team gets one point for a tie. 
There also exits these things called ""wins"".  A win is when one team has a
higher score than the opponent.  (Oh yeah, only two teams play each other
at a time, so I can say ""the opponent"".)  A team gets two points for a
win.  So, let's say that a team has a record of 38 wins, 36 losses, and 10
ties.  Another team has a record of 40 wins, 38 losses and 6 ties.  The
first team has (38*2)+10 = 86 points.  The second team has (40*2)+6 = 86
points.  WOW!  They *both* have the same number of points, but the number
of wins is different!  How did they do that??!?!?!?!  That's amazing.  So,
Rex, when people talk about wins being the first tiebreaker, well, then
that's what it means.  In our example, the second team would win the
tiebreaker and therefore have the ""better"" record, even though both teams
had the same number of points.  If you didn't understand this post, Rex,
maybe you should go back and read it again, very slowly.

What is the policy regarding players and the minor league playoffs versus WC?
I know that the Rangers are holding back Kovalev, Zubov, and Andersson for
Binghamton, but I also know that the Whalers wanted Michael Nylander to play
for Springfield, while Nylander wanted to play for Sweden. The Whalers allowed
the NHL to decide, and the NHL chose the WCs. How does this differ from the
Rangers and Oilers? Did the Whalers have to go through the league, or could
they have forced Nylander to play in Springfield?",sports

much nicer than that Kaminiecki and Mike Witt combo I thought they'd throw
out their to the slaughterhouse because of their ""experience"". Granted, Witt
""might"" be good, but I think that they used rationale to keep the youngsters
up and not given the job to Witt because he was a good pitcher and has

  Now that the Anahaim team is becomming real I'm really beginning to believe

too.  After 2000 the NHL will abandond ice-rinks.  It's so expensive to cool 
down the rinks in the subtropics and the locals hardly know what ice is 
anyway.  NHL will become a roller skating hockey league.  That way it can 
create more public interest in the game when local supporteres can play the

Look how long the Maple Leafs and Nordiques used similar logic....  Not that
they fielded bad teams solely to field bad teams, but the Maple Leafs (and a
certain dead man who was in charge) were one of the cheapest teams in the
history of the sport.  Guess what-- they were immensely popular at the
gate.  The Nordiques have also done well for a team that had missed the
playoffs so many years in a row.

them don't make it home from the match!  The soccer fans tend to be fanatical,

Are most players who come up young always good when they're young, or
later?


Damn.  I was afraid you would say that!


Well, perhaps if the Braves had no one else worth playing this year it
would be Lopez in there.  But they do have others worth playing, at
least in *their* opinion.  And I happen to agree.


I can believe that.  I'm a newbie here, so I'll take your word.  But
Alomar *is* a fine defensive catcher, which was my statement above.
That is a solid reason for bringing him up at a tender age, as long
as they feel he can also hit a bit.  Lopez does not have such a
consensus about his defensive prowess, and imho that is enough to
give him that dreaded ""seasoning"".


Sorry.  New.  Don't know Nichols' Law.  Don't believe in catchers'
era.  But I am interested in pitchers' eras with different catchers.
Any info on that?


In other words, we know more than they do, so the only logic behind 
a different decision than we would make must be financial.  I presume
we feel this way about other franchises than Atlanta, no?


Well if it does make organizational sense, one can hardly fault them
for their decisions.  I mean, please don't tell me how to run my
business.  Especially when I'm being successful.


I'm sure you could be right.  You could also be smoking some illegal
substance.

(Hey.  That's a joke.  Don't get offended.  Please.)

Well, I can't cite anyone's ethical rectitude because I don't know
what it means.  :)

But again, if it makes organizational sense, then so be it.  Baseball
is a business, and if there is a solid business reason for keeping
Lopez on the farm then that's what the Braves *should* do.

I happen to believe that it's a baseball decision.  While you from
your armchair may disagee, I don't.  I think there is a lot of
evidence to suggest the decision they made.  I predicted it among
large guffaws from several at the start of spring training.  I
think it is a very *normal* decision to have made.  It is certainly
more reversible than to have started Lopez in the bigs and have
released one of their catchers.  Sure, it may be conservative.  It
may also be logical.  I don't know what ethics have to do with it.
Seems like pretty good common sense to me.

Ok, here's the solution to your problem.  Move to Canada.  Yesterday I was able

I have two tv's in my house, and I set them up side-by-side to watch MON-QUE

Whatever you say.  I think it's just 12 games into the season myself, so
I'm going to wait a bit before calling names.


I expect that Dave Otto will be a really bad pitcher, and I have no
idea why Simmons ever wanted him.  On the other hand, I expect him to
release Otto if he doesn't turn things around pretty fast.  (BTW,
Otto's game score for that 0 IP stinker was only 22, which points out
a problem with the method since Otto's performance was infinitely bad,
and excruciatingly prolonged.)


I think Merced's rookie year was a bit flukey, but aren't you willing to
give him some more at bats (and Tomlin a few more starts) before acting
so gloomy?


No he didn't.  Walk is a time bomb.  He has no stuff whatsoever, and when
the league finally realizes this, it won't be pretty at all.


Don't be so fast.  Doughty is the guy who signed Steve Buechele, which
was a move that threatened to bury Kevin Young in the minors.
Meanwhile, I'm not sure whether Doughty or Simmons signed Martin as a
six-year free agent before the 1992 season.


Twice through the rotation, and you've given up?  Yikes.


But so has his age, at least in baseball terms.  The useful half-life
of a 34- year-old injury-prone catcher can't be much longer than a year.


But he wanted to be a Dodger, and felt he had something to prove after his
disastrous 1992.  I don't think there was any chance for the Bucs to sign
him.


He certainly wasn't last year.


Hey, that's the ""Skates Smith"" package deal.  Anybody who acquires
Lonnie for his defense or base-running (particularly at this stage) is
a real weirdo.


If that's the goal of the team ownership, than I don't see why Sauer
gets a zero for making his boss happy.  I don't know what he has or
hasn't said about revenue sharing, so I can't comment there.


It's annoying, but since Leyland seems to have been pushing for them
to retain Jeff King, it was probably unavoidable.  Meanwhile, I think
bigger accomplishments of Simmons' tenure were getting some value for
John Smiley, not trading real prospects for veterans down the stretch
last year, drafting well in 1992, letting the rookies show something
in 1993.  Foley, Smith, and Candelaria were acquired to be replacement
parts, which means that even if fail it hasn't done serious damage to
the Bucs' future.


Does this mean that the Bucs lost the initial arbitration case?  I
never heard the outcome of this.  When will the final verdict be in on
this?


I'm not sure who was the idiot in this case, so I don't know who to
blame.  It might have been Doug Danforth, after all.  In fact, I
*seriously* suspect it was Doug Danforth, who has shown his
willingness to call the shots at exactly those moments when the gun is
pointed at his feet.

off-site, so if somebody known to impersonate e.e. cummings can see
this, would he drop me a short note?)",sports

Well, actually now that you mention it, a few weeks ago the CBC ran a
documentary on ""Ice Hockey in Harlem"".  the Canadian Club of New York
(something like that) sponsors a league for kids in Harlem and based on
the TV report they all seemed to be having a lot of fun.  All playing
with regular equipment, jerseys, etc etc, on a proper outdoor rink.  It
looked just like kids playing hockey anywhere else.",sports
"


I'll have to disagree with you on this one. I think Vancouver will go as
Bure goes, and if he continues on his goal scoring slump, then they
won't even make it out of the first round. I think the Kings will make
it out of the first round, regardless of who they play. They seem to be
doing pretty well, even with that bad game against Minnesota on
Saturday. I think it'll be either Calgary or Los Angeles to win the
Smythe (i.e. go on to the conference finals). ",sports
"

There are several problems with the way the game is being presented to the
fans.  I feel that geographical names would enhance regional loyalties
more than names honouring personages.  And of course, they would not appear
nearly as confusing to one approaching the sport for the first time.  
Another thing that bothers me is the points system.  Percentages, as used in
the other major sports are clearly more informative.  When I look at the
NHL standings the first thing I have to do is make a quick calculation to
account for games in hand (which is almost always the case).  Some will
object to percentages, claiming perhaps, that it is an ""Americanization""
of the sport but I feel that using percentages is more informative and
whether it is ""American"" or not is irrelevant.
 

Even if Orr couldn't have contributed without the likes of Norris, you would
have to agree that Norris couldn't have contributed without the likes of Orr.
And taking a poll of most fans would quickly tell you who the fans feel made
the more meaningful contribution.



It doesn't look as if the division names are going to hold up either does it?

It was Bryan Trottier, not Denis Potvin.  It was a vicious

But Roger, what the hell does this have to do with Gainey's skill

I would take Fuhr and Sanderson off of the latter.

"Apparently, Part 2 (defensemen numbered 2 through 19) was lost when I posted
it; to make things worse, I lost my own copy.  I have asked on the Sharks
mailing list, on which it did get out, to see if someone can mail me a copy
back.  If someone responds, I will repost it when I get it; otherwise, I will
re-write it in a day or two and post it.  Sorry about that.

#8	LARRY DEPALMA		Season:	3rd
Acquired:	'91-92, free agent from Minnesota
Grade:		I (C-/D+)

No netter/fan watching the Sharks, including me, knows where DePalma was at
the end of the season; the Sharks appeared to still have his rights, but he
wasn't in San Jose, he wasn't in Kansas City, and his name hasn't appeared on
the waiver wire.  And that kind of invisibility was prevalent for the most part
for DePalma.  After being called up October 30 against the Tampa Bay Lightning,
DePalma had an excellent week, scoring 5 points in 3 games while playing good
defense.  Unfortunately, the 27-year-old DePalma then disappeared the rest of
the way, getting just 3 more points in 15 more games, and generally looked
lethargic and uninterested on both ends of the ice.  He then was sent down to
Kansas City, walked out from there, and was suspended and later reinstated
when it was revealed that he was injured; he then promptly disappeared from
the watching eyes of Shark Bytes (as the mailing list is now known to Sharks
officials) faithful, and neither the Sharks nor we miss him.

#10	JOHAN GARPENLOV		Season: 3rd
Acquired:	'91-92, trade with Detroit for D Bob McGill and 8th round
		pick in '92 entry draft from Vancouver
Grade:		A/A-

After an early slump, Garpenlov was nothing short of inspirational the rest
of the way, finishing with 66 points in 79 games, second highest total on the
team, as he clicked well with team MVP Kelly Kisio and right wing Rob
Gaudreau.  Kisio got most of the credit, but Garpenlov, finishing second in
the MVP voting, clearly demonstrated his playmaking and scoring skills, as he
was seen making excellent centering passes as well as finishing passes to him
by putting the puck past opposing goaltenders, getting a club-high 14 power-
play goals.  Contrary to his previous rep, Garpenlov also showed that despite
his small size (5' 11"", 183 lbs.), he was willing to throw himself around
when necessary, albeit not very successful yet.  He also still needs to work
on his defense, although he improved tremendously throughout the season, and
was actually quite a good penalty killer by the end of the season.  He will
be a major key to the offense next year.

#15	DAVID BRUCE		Season: 5th
Acquired:	'91-92, from St. Louis in expansion draft
Grade:		I (?)

After a banner '91-92, when he led the team in power-play goals (10) and
was third in total scoring (38 points in 60 games), Bruce was bothered
virtually all of this season with a groin injury, which kept him out of the
lineup for all by 17 games this season.  Of course, it is difficult to
speculate how well he would have done this season had he not been affected by
the injury, but the 28-year-old Bruce was effective with a man up or a man
short in the Sharks' first season, and was expected to be a strong offensive
leader this season as well.  The injury appears serious, which is a shame,
because otherwise he may have a much brighter future for now; instead, his
future with the Sharks next season appears clouded.

#18	MARK PEDERSON		Season:	3rd
Acquired:	'92-93, trade with Philadelphia for C/LW Dave Snuggerud
Grade:		I (B)

It is difficult for me to understand the Flyers' decision to unload Pederson,
after a very good offensive season last season (40 points in 58 games), but
after riding the pine early in the season, Pederson was summarily sent to the
Sharks in exchange of the defensive-minded Snuggerud, and he finished with
41 games combined with the Flyers and the Sharks.  He was also limited by
injuries this season, and this limited his production (17 points).  But when
healthy, Pederson appears impressive, with a good scoring touch, good size
(and the willingness to throw it around, although he's not considered a
physical forward), and good speed.  He also does not appear to be a liability
on defense, but the Sharks probably have to wait until next season to see how
much, exactly, Pederson can do.

#20	JOHN CARTER		Season: 4th
Acquired:	'91-92, free agent from Boston
Grade:		I (B+/B)

Carter was definitely one of the hardest workers on the team, and the hard
work worked wonders, as at times he looked great on ice.  However, although he
did look great at times, the fact that he received just 16 points (in 55
games) for his efforts is a sign that there is only so much his hard work can
do, and the Sharks confirmed that by sending him to Kansas City with about
20 games left in the season.  Carter, who will turn 30 on May 6, always
hussled, but as a result, was sometimes trapped too deep within the offensive
zone while forechecking, but he was generally a credit on the defensive end,
but he is probably of limited utility in that capacity, and he did not impress
offensively, although he was one of the best Sharks at drawing penalties.  He
is very unlikely to be back next season.

#28	JEAN-FRANCOIS QUINTIN	Season: 1st
Acquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		I (B+/B)

I don't understand why the Sharks didn't let Quintin play any more than the
14 games he played this season.  He was generally hard-working and creating
opportunities offensively, and appeared, at age 23, ready for regular NHL
duty, at least for a team like the Sharks, finishing with 7 points in those
14 games while not being a defensive liability.  Shoulder injury in training
camp before the '91-92 season limited Quintin, the team's leading scorer in
exhibition games despite sitting out the final two, to just 29 games with the
Sharks and the Blades that season, but he looked impressive.  He should be a
solid contender for regular duty next season.

#41	MARK BEAUFAIT		Season: 1st
Acquired:	2nd round pick in 1991 supplemental draft
Grade:		I (?)

After a all-star season at Kansas City, Beaufait got a cup of coffey with the
Sharks late in the season when the Blades knocked down a playoff spot and the
Sharks decimated with injuries, playing 5 games and scoring a goal for his only
NHL point thus far.  Despite small size (5' 9"", 165 lbs.), Beaufait was not shy
to throw himself around when necessary, and looked pretty good at times,
although it's too early to judge him based on 5 NHL games, in which he played
mostly left wing, away from his center position at Northern Michigan and
Kansas City.

#42	JAROSLAV OTEVREL	Season: 1st
Acquired:	8th round pick in 1991 entry draft
Grade:		I (?)

Like Beaufait, Otevrel also played away from his normal position when he was
up for his cup of tea (7 games) midway through the season.  He was generally
very much of a defensive liability, and did not show much offensively either,
although that may be more indicative of the lack of ice time he got in those
7 games.  He may need another season to work on his defense, but once his
defense is acceptable, he should be ready.

#44	MICHEL PICARD		Season: 1st
Acquired:	'92-93, trade with Hartford for LW Yvon Corriveau
Grade:		I (B-/C+)

The 23-year-old Picard, although he perennially tore up the minors, seems to
be close to being out of chances, for some reason, after being acquired by the
Sharks but failing to impress the management in 25 games, scoring 4 goals for
his only points, and he spent most of the rest of the way in Kansas City.
He was not particularly strong defensively, and despite his offensive
brilliance in the minors, he has failed thus far to score in the NHL, although
he has been given limited opportunities.  He may be the Sharks' bait in the
expansion draft.

#45	DODY WOOD		Season: 1st
Acquired:	3rd round pick in 1991 entry draft
Grade:		I (D+/D, although perhaps I shouldn't give a grade at all)

I have been accused of knocking on Wood too much. :-)  Then, it is probably
no surprise to you that I am thoroughly unimpressed by Wood thus far, although
13 games is a small example.  He was generally a nonfactor on offense, was
not particularly good defensively, and took too many silly penalties, losing
many fights in the process and gathering 69 penalty minutes in those 13 games,
projecting to to 446(!) in an 84-game season.  He's not ready, and needs at
least another season at KC, where he can work on his fighting skills, if
nothing else.  His relatively small size (5' 11"", 181 lbs.) does not give much
possibility that he can survive, at this stage, as an enforcer.",sports

During the regular season, when the intensity is down, not many teams

"Kevin Mitchell's sacrifice fly in the eighth off Brett Saberhagen plated 
pitch runner Cesar Hernandez to give the Reds a 2-3 come-from-behind victory over 
New York. Hernandez ran for pinch-hitter Cecil Espy, who got the inning started 
with a solid single to right, moved to second on ""Bob"" Kelly's infield sneaker
down the third-base line, and to third on Jeff Branson's well-placed bunt--a 
rare show of excellent execution by the recently hapless Reds offense.

Cincinnati trailed 2-0 after starter Tim Pugh blinked in the fifth.  He had only 
given up one hit in the first four innings, a fourth-inning lead-off double
by Vince Coleman.  Coleman was left stranded at third by Bobby Bonilla after
Joe Orselak popped to short.  Orselak was pinch-hitting for Eddie Murray who 
argued plate umpire Kellogg's inside strike by ""drawing the line"" (really, he
should know better than that).  Murray, and later manager Jeff Torborg ended up getting
tossed.

The Mets' fifth started with a Howard Johnson's first-pitch homer.  Pugh must 
have been slightly shaken, as he was popped on the next pitch by Jeff Kent's
single, then a Ryan Thompson liner to left was (surprise) misplayed by Mitchell
and turned into a RBI triple. Catcher Hundley's grounder to the drawn-in Branson
failed to bring Thompson in, then the play of the game occured:

Saberhagen was due up, so Reds pitching coach Larry Rothschild met with the infield
to discuss the possibility of a suicide squeeze.  They called it perfectly:
Thompson was hung out to dry after Pugh's first-pitch pitch out and the threat ended.
(Isn't the NATIONAL LEAGUE great??)

The Reds picked up 2 runs in the seventh to knot up the game.  After Barry Larkin's
ground out, Mitchell, Chris Sabo, and Randy Milligan got back-to-back-to-back
singles--the third scoring Mitchell.  Reggie Sanders then plated Sabo with a long
fly to center.  A double by Oliver might have scored runner Dan Wilson, but
third base coach Dave Bristol threw up the stop sign too late--Wilson himself was
hung out to dry killing the Reds rally.

Rob Dibble came on in the ninth and pitched shakily.  With two outs and a runner
on second Bonilla came to the plate and all I could think of was the Sunday game
in late August last year when Bonilla's three-run dinger slapped a loss on
Dibble and spelled the beginning of the end for Cinci's season.  Bonilla ended
up walking, and HoJo flied out to left to give the Reds their first win in a 
week, and earned Dibble his third save in as many opportunities.  The win went
to Steve Foster (1-2) who got in what must be an ego-boosting two perfect innings
work, striking out three.  Saberhagen (2-1) got the loss--though I'm a bit
surprised he even pitched in the eighth.  I'll take it, though.

The Reds are now 3-9, still the worst team in baseball with the Royals victory
today.  The Mets are 6-5.

"As I promised, I would give you the name of the Panther's president.
After Huizenga announced the team name, he announced that Bill
Torrey is named the first president of the Panthers.

A little Bio from _Sun-Sentinel_
Torrey, the architect of four consecutive Stanley Cup champions as 
persident and general manager of the New York Islanders.
Throughout his 27 years in the NHL, Bill Torrey's bow ties have become
as much of a signature as Andre Agassi's hair.

The Panthers will introduce a uniform, insignia, and ticket-price 
information in early next month.  In the meantime, Huizenga leaves the
day-to-day operation in the hands of Torrey and Bob Clarke, the VP and
GM.

The Florida Panthers was chosen as the name of South Florida's NHL team
to focus attention on an endangered species.  There are 30 to 50 Florida
Panthers in the Everglades National Park, the Big Cypress National 
Preserve and other parts of southwestern Florida.

""The Panther is the quickest-striking of all cats,"" Torrey said.  
""Hopefully that's the way we'll play on ice.""

More BIO:
In Torrey, Huizenga has the first man hired by the expansion Islanders
in 1972 and the one most responsible for guiding the Islanders to four
consecutive Stanley Cup championships (their first after only eight
seasons) and 14 consecutive winning seasons.  As executive vice president
of the California Golden Seals, Torrey watched the Seals go to the play-
offs in 1968, only their second NHL season.

""I guess this completes my own personal hat trick"", said Torrey, 58, a
native of Montreal but a resident of Bear Lakes Country Club in Palm
Beach.

"I've noticed that is has become fashionable lately in rsb to predict
the Marlines to finish ahead of the Cubs....how?

First Base:

Grace vs Destrade...Could Destrade be the second coming of Cecil
Fielder? I doubt it. If Destrade performs to the height of expectations,
then even, otherwise, edge to Cubs

Second Base:

Sandberg vs Barberie...No contest. Sandberg will be back May 1. Edge
to Cubs...a big edge.

Shortstop:

Vizcaino vs Weiss...Vizcaino is excellent defensively, but is an
automatic out at bat. Weiss isn't much better with the stick. Even.

Third Base:

Dave Magadan vs Buechelle...Magadan has a higher OBP and is a better hitter.
Buechelle has more power and is better defensively (I think) Edge to
Florida.

Catcher: 

Santiago vs Wilkins...Wilkins is OK, but Santiago is better. Edge to
Marlins

Left Field:

Conine vs Maldonado...Wow! 4 for 4 yesterday...I know Conine has potential.
I watched him play at Omaha the last couple years. Until he actually proves
himself, I give Maldonado the edge, however, like at 1B, this is position
where Florida might be even or better *if* the player there has a huge year.

Center:

Scott Pose vs Wilson/May...Edge to May, even if Wilson. Hopefully the
Cubs will use may and save Wilson for pinch running and the like. May
isn't Ken Griffey Jr, but he will hit .275 with 15 homers if he plays
full time.

Right:

Felix vs Sosa...Felix Jose has occasional power and a bad OBP. So does
Sosa, but Sosa also has speed and a good glove. Edge to Cubs

Starters:

Aquino? Armstrong? Hammond? A lot of fifth starters here. The Cubs won't
remind anyone of the Brave staff, but Morgan-Castillo-Guzman-Hibbard
is average to OK...better than the Marline. Edge to Cubs

Middle Relief:

Even. The Cubs have some decent middlemen, and so do the Marlins.
Carpenter anf Klink or decent, but so are Assenmacher and McElroy.

Closer:

A healthy Harvey is a big edge to the Marlins. Meyers is decent, but
no Harvey. Of course, the Cubs may have a few more games to save.
Look for 30 saves, 5 blown from Meyers, and 25 saves, 3 blown (with
a better ERA) for Harvey. Edge Florida.

Overall, an edge to Chicago.
Neither of these teams will threaten to win anything, of course.

"As the Sharks' season came to a close tonight, I will start a series of posts,
trying to revisit the players, the trades, the moves, etc., that went through
for the Sharks for the past season.  If you are uninterested, since I will
have the words SHARKS REVIEW in the subject heading in these postings, you can
kill them.

I will first try to evaluate how the players did.  These ratings, of course,
are subject to my own biases, but I hope that I can try to be as objective as
possible.  I will evalute players who finished the season with the Sharks
and/or did not play for another NHL team this season.

Thus, then, let's go to the goaltenders...

#1	BRIAN HAYWARD		Season:	11th
Acquired:	'91-92 from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		P (D)

It is sad that his career has to come to this dim an end, a career that
featured sharing three Jennings Trophies (with Patrick Roy, in '87, '88, and
'89).  It would indeed be unfair for me to do anything but give him a passing
grade (and skip the letter grading), but he had simply been awful on ice this
year, save for a bright spot or two, and even if he had been healthy, he would
not be any more than the 3rd-string goalie.

But Hayward was a classy individual, who also figured in on the Sharks' first
ever victory, the 3rd game of the season last year against the Calgary Flames.
As he retires, the fans will remember what a good guy he was.

#30	JEFF HACKETT		Season: 3rd
Acquired:	'91-92, from N. Y. Islanders in expansion draft
Grade:		C

Hackett, after (deservedly) winning the team MVP honors last season, simply
wasted the year.  Other than a few good spots (57 saves against Los Angeles,
almost-shutout against Tampa Bay, etc.), Hackett, finishing with 85.6% save
percentage and a 5.28 GAA, watched his status go from the team's #1 goalie to
bench decoration at the end of the season.  He was expected, early, to carry
the team along; instead, he apparently became frustrated, but the an early
injury that forced him to miss 12 games may have been a contributing factor,
but upon return, he simply wasn't up to the task.  He may not return next
year.

#31	WADE FLAHERTY		Season: 1st (still eligible as rookie)
Acquired:	'91-92, signed as undrafted free agent
Grade:		I (A-)

It is pretty hard to evaluate a goaltender on just one game alone, thus the
incomplete grade, but yet in the one start that he did get (against the Calgary
Flames), Flaherty was nothing but sharp for at least two periods.  He started
the season poorly in Kansas City, but finished strong, prompting the Blades'
owner Ron Parker to comment that he should be a candidate for the IHL MVP
honors.  The upcoming IHL playoffs would be a major challenge for him as he
tries to make it into the NHL; last year, he was a capable backup for Arturs
Irbe in the throughout the season and in the Turner Cup playoffs, picking up
all-star honors along with Irbe; now it's time for him to show that he can
share the job with Irbe next year, because with prospects Dan Ryder, Trevor
Robins, and Scott Cashman coming along, if he doesn't make it next year, he
may not ever.

#32	ARTURS IRBE		Season:	1st
Acquired:	'91-92, from Minnesota in dispersal draft
Grade:		B+

I may yet be overly critical of Irbe in a year that he clearly established that
he's a bona fide NHL goaltender, perhaps a bona fide #1 goaltender.  He has
provided most of the little highlight footage that the Sharks team had, getting
the team's first ever shut-out against the Los Angeles Kings on December 26.
He has been fearless in and out of the net, aggressively playing the puck and
making passes, reminding people of a young Ron Hextall (except, of course, the
goonism).  Yet he still needs to develop more consistency, which is hard to do
with such a bad defense in front of him, but if the Sharks are to challenge for
a playoff spot next season, Irbe's the key, as he demonstrated in being named
as a star of the game 13 times in 32 starts.",sports

According to this morning's Post-Gazette:

The Pens will be carried by KDKA-Radio(1020 am), unless the Pirates
are playing.  When the Pirates play, the games will be carried by 
WDVE(102.5 fm).  WDVE will carry 12 games, starting with tonight's
game.

In fact, after this season, KDKA will no longer be the flagship
station for the Pens.  The Penguins and KBL have struck a new 
deal regarding the TV and radio rights to the games.  It seems
more than likely that WDVE will be the flagship radio station next 
season.  KBL will carry 62 games on tv,  with 17 of the games to be 
simulcast on KDKA-TV.  The remaining 22 games, as well as some of the 
early round playoff games, will be available by ""subscription tv"" only.
To receive the games, you'll have to pay a one time hook up fee, and
then a monthly fee of $11-12 dollars.

Also, under the new deal, there will no longer be radio/tv 
simulcasts.  There will be a TV broadcast team, and a radio
broadcast team.  

No word on who the announcers will be.  Mike Lange and Paul Steigerwald
are both under contract with KDKA, but their contracts expire at the

"Did anyone notice the words ""NOT FOR BASEBALL"" printed on the picture

Also, I just noticed something looking at the Nolan Ryan timeline in
the preview. On 8/22/89, Rickey Henderson became Nolan's 5000th strikeout.
On 6/11/90 he pitched his 6th no-hitter against Oakland. I believe the
last out in the game was made by Rickey Henderson. And on 5/1/91, Nolan
pitched his 7th no-hitter on the same day a certain someone stole his
939th base, which overshadowed it. It seems that Nolan is having a lot of
publicity at Rickey's expense. IMO, Rickey deserves it, and it seems as
most of the net agrees with me from what I've seen on it lately. They are
both great players, but IMO, Nolan has outclassed Rickey, both in playing
and more importantly, in attitude. Just my thoughts.",sports

Sorry to disappoint you but the Red Wings earned the victory...easily.

I watched most of the game on ESPN (as soon as I realized that they
were televising the game which was at the beginning of the second).
The Maple Leafs were flat.  Very flat.  Meanwhile, the Red Wings were
skating very freely and dictating the pace of the game.  I didn't
detect any bad penalty calls (Van Hellemond did his usual good job).
Toronto looked like how I expected them to for their first playoff
game in a few years -- nervous.

"After reading some of the reports of possible NHL moves to Milwaukee or that
Milwaukee should have an NHL team, I thought I'd pass along a story I heard
recently.  This is second hand, so I don't know how true it is, but I have
no reason to doubt it either.

Bradley Center in Milwaukee is home to the Milwaukee Admirals minor leauge
hockey team.  The owner of the Admirals (sorry, I can't remember his name)
either owns or at least shelled out the majority of the funds to build the
Bradley Center.

Supposedly he was approached by the NHL about an expansion franchise, but 
turned it down because he thought the franchise fee of $50 million was too
high.

Like I said, I don't know whether this story is true or just a rumor, but if
it's true, don't look for an NHL team in Milwaukee anytime soon.  The Admirals
aren't going to be forced out of the building and you won't see an NHL club
and a minor league club in the same building, especially since the NBA's
Milwaukee Bucks play there as well.",sports
"

     Would you say the same thing about the Dodgers in '65 or '66?  True,
Cone is probably as good as Drysdale, and they have no Koufax, but still,
these teams were winning with home run leaders who had very bad totals, with
lots of low-scoring games, etc.  And they didn't use relievers, whereas
Jeff Montgomery is having a super season for them.
     That being said, I still picked them 5th or so, but I think a superb
pitching team can win if they have enough hitting.  There's more of a
chance of that, I think, than of a team with tremendous hitting but no
pitching.  At least, to me.
     I wonder, though - which one do you people think would do better - a team
with Johnson, Koufax in his prime, Seaver, Carlton, and Young, in no real
order, as the starters, with Sutter, Fingers, and Lyle in the bullpen, but
with a puny offense (assuming good defense, like Mazeroski, Maranville, etc.)
Or a team with poor pitching, but with an offense of Cobb, Carew, Ruth, Gehrig,
Mays, Schmidt, Wagner, and Bench - again,you pick the order.
     I would postulate that the pitching one would be several games better by
seasons' end.  Even the best hitters can succeed only 2/5 of the time in
their best years, but a great pitcher can throw lots of shutouts - taking all
the players in their prime, they might throw 50 shutouts in a year.  And all
the offense would have to do is get 1 run across.
     I wonder if someone with Stratomatic or something could plug such all-
time teams into a regular season, have it played, and report the results
I would love to see that.",sports

Okay, here's the down side of the ESPN deal: no additional coverage.
With a split contract, SCA could have at least gotten at leftovers
like Canucks-Jets, Caps-whoever and Red Wings-Leafs (or whoever else
is playing).


For our area (Islanders-Devils), it's likely to be the Bruins, since
the other Adams series is Montreal-Quebec.  I'd prefer the latter
myself ...

I'm under the impression that the ABC deal overrides the local deals,

Educate yourself before you rip on this years manager of the year.
Lankford injured himself in a previous game and Torre was resting
him.

As far as the Whitten/Gilkey controversy.  Whitten adds some more
needed power, and if Jordan continues to hit the way he has been,
Gilkey will find himself in the starting lineup soon enough.

     It depends on which uniforms you are talking about.  For the last
couple of years I believe Toronto and Pittsburgh has used the same uniforms,
or at least very similar.  The home jerseys had the team nick name
(Blue Jays or Pirates), but the road jerseys had the name of the city
(Toronto or Pittsburgh).  I believe this is the way most teams design
their uniforms.

Yes, it's a shame that the NHL lost a fine team in one of the best
hockey markets in the country.  Being a North Stars fan, it is sad to
see all of the tradition of the last 26 years get thrown into oblivion

a team had to win two seven-game series - in other words it took 8

One of the chapters in Palmer and Thorn's 'Hidden Game' is titled
'Pitching is 44% of Baseball,' implying that fielding is 6%.  How do
they determine that?  Beats me -- it's been a long, long time since I
read it.

One also has to separate offense into batting and baserunning, with the
split probably somewhere around 49.5% and 0.5%.

	The defenition of the Underdog is a team that has no talent and comes
out of nowhere to contend.  The '69 Mets and '89 Orioles are prime examples,
not the Cubs.  I root for the Cubs, because I feel sorry for them, but 
basically they are dogs.  The Pirates today are a great example of an underdog.
If the Rockies and Marlins compete, they will be underdogs.  The North Stars
trip to the Stanley Cup finals was a good example of an underdog's journey. 
The Cubs have a good team this year, and play in a weak division, they are much
less than America's Team.

Owen only has one error so far, I believe.  That seriously
underrepresents the harm he has done in the field.

Owen will cleanly play any ball he reaches.  He will have a fine
fielding percentage, like always.  The problem is that he doesn't
reach anything that isn't hit straight at him!

This wouldn't be quite as obvious a problem if he were playing next to
Kelly Gruber or Robin Ventura.  But the third baseman for the Yankees
is Wade Boggs (who should have moved across the diamond *last* year)!

I've only seen one game, Abbott's first start, but there were three
balls hit to the left side which would have been stopped by quality
defensive players.  Instead they were charged as hits against Abbott.",sports

Geez, Gerald.  Like anyone reading rec.flamefest.hockey.pens.are.great
didn't know that Le-Mow was from Quebec.",sports
"
No.  Patrick Roy is the reason the game was lost, and Ron Hextall is the
reason Quebec won.  Everybody said it would come down to goaltending, that
goaltending was the key, etc etc.  Well, the key doesn't quite fit if you're
Montreal.  The Dionne penalty was kind of a cheesy call, but let's face it;
he literally left his feet to throw an elbow.  Blaming Stewart is just an
excuse to avoid facing the fact that Roy allowed what was one of the worst
goals he could possibly allow.  He even saw the whole shot, dammit.  Besides,
Stewart evened things up a bit by calling a Quebec penalty in OT.

Montreal played a solid game (although they still don't know how to clear
traffic in front of the net; the loss of Schneider will hurt even more). 
Normally I would say that any team that blows a 2-goal lead with less than 
five, let alone two, minutes to go in regulation time IN A PLAYOFF GAME 
ESPECIALLY needs to be smacked upside their collective heads.  But I don't
think this was a team loss (although Keane should have been able to clear 
the zone just prior to the first Quebec goal).  Roy is paid big money to 
play.  He looked like a player in an industrial league on Sakic's shot.

Demers should start Racicot in the next game.  If not that, he should let
the damn team read the papers for the next day or two....and maybe this
article, if possible.


I didn't think the wrap-around was as bad as the second goal.  I also didn't
think Scott Young should have gotten around the defender (can't remember who)
in the first place.  But you are correct, it shouldn't have gone in
regardless.


Yep.  Moog looked bad on Mogilny's goal with five seconds left in the second,
IMO.  How about Neely though?   Holy shit, what a player.

Speaking of great players, man-oh-man can Quebec skate.  I haven't seen a
team so potent on the rush in a long time.  Watching them break out of their
zone, especially Sundin, is a treat to watch.  They remind me of the Red 
Army.  

But I still hate the team.

On the rest of the games:  Didn't St. Louis' winning goal come on a
powerplay?  Penalties will cost Chicago dearly, especially against Detroit. 
Same goes for Calgary; very, very undisciplined.  When Marty McSorely is
waving guys to the bench to *avoid* fights, you know something's up.  New
Jersey was overmatched, Terreri's heroics notwithstanding.  Mario is
unbelievable, and Jagr for some reason shows up in the playoffs.  But I 
hate that team anyway.

First is that the way the sun was shining in Miami, it had a summer

bundled up fans.  

The second and most important was the fans.  I like these guys/gals!
I will admit I am a football fan first but I still enjoy baseball.
It was interesting because most of these fans are only accustomed to
the Miami Dolphins.  The way they were cheering, I thought it was the
AFC playoffs.  Of course opening day may have A LOT to do with it,
but I really got feeling of electricity that I think is lacking with
a lot of baseball fans in other cities.

Later on, in your posting, you make reference to ""putting words

mistake.  If you actually read what I've written, you will find
that I make no such claim...soooo, if logic serves me well,
you're contradicting yourself.
 
 
 
 
Roger, I'm not sure here, but I think ""ignorance"" is really a
function of ""a lack of knowledge"" and not ""formulating an

means go ahead...that's if it makes you feel better.
 
 
 
 
My word, such vehemence against poor ol' Bob Gainey.  Why does
he bother you so much...he was an effective player for his style
of play.
 
 
 
I'm really sorry Roger, but you have lost me completely here. 
Why don't you ask me if I would rather have Jesus Christ,
himself, in nets?
 
Now, if you were to compare, say for example, Bob Gainey with Guy
Carbonneau, you would have a balanced comparison.
 
 
 
I'm wrong AGAIN...hmmm, let's see...where was I wrong in the
first place?  I'm only guessing here, Rog, but I have a feeling
that you've setup a ""You're wrong again"" macro key on your
machine.
 
I agree that my use of the word plugger is simplistic...but I
think you know what I'm getting at.  I would also like to point
out that Gilmour's potential as a Selke-winner was never part of
the debate...are you asking me for an opinion?  If so, I think
there are far too many other deserving players to include Gilmour
among the candidates.
 
 
I would suggest that your comment: ""And when the press runs out
of things to say about  the stars on dynasties they start to hype
the pluggers.  Grant Fuhr, Essa Tikkannen, Butch Goring, Bob
Nystrom, Bob Gainey, Doug Jarvis, Derek Sanderson, Wayne Cashman,
Bob Baun, Bob Pulford, Ralph Backstrom, Henri Richard, Dick
Duff...and so on..."" demonstrates a blanket disregard for these
individuals as contributors to the game...so yes, settle
down...nobody has claimed that they are hockey gods.

These players all are pretty good players.  They are the depth that the
dynasties had to win Stanley Cups.  They tend to be the very good second
line guys- who would be first liners on most weaker clubs in the NHL.
They were all important to their clubs.  Probably, several of these
Stanley Cup winning teams would not have won the cups they did if it
were not for the depth provided by these players.

They compare to Rick Tocchet and Ron Francis of the Penguins.  Very good
players who can lead lesser teams (Francis-Hartford, Tocchet-Philly) who
provide the depth to the team that is currently best in the NHL.

As a defensive forward, there have been none better than Bob Gainey.  That
doesn't mean he was the best player (or even the best forward) the Canadians
had at that time, but he was excellent at what he did.  Gainey could
dominate games with his defence.  He didn't need to get goals to dominate.
He shut down the opposition and was thus valuable.  There has never been
anyone any better at doing this.  Not ever.",sports

  The same Bill James? Why do you say that? It sounds like you're suggesting 
Bill James had something to do with overhyping the kid to death. Au contraire;
he was fairly critical of him after his ROY campaign, noting that he wasn't
all-world as a catcher or a hitter. He called him basically average when
everyone *else* in the media was predicting the next Johnny Bench or Roy
Campanella. 


  Which reports are those? 


  I like Hernandez a lot, but if Piazza can catch the ball, you've gotta play
him IMHO. He's a much better hitter, although Hernandez isn't a *bad* hitter.
Right now, it sounds like Piazza will catch most of the time and Hernandez
will be Candiotti's caddy since he can catch the knuckler. As long as they
play up to their abilities, the Dodgers could have a very good catching
tandem.  


  I think both are overrated defensively (see Nichols' Law of catcher
defense), but that's something that's difficult to prove or disprove from
your viewpoint or mine. About the only tangible thing we can look at is
opponent's SB%, and that's clouded by how well your pitchers hold runners.
Catchers ERA is a possibility, but it's subject to way too many biases. 

  As for them 'playing on a team that is not so much in need of another big
bat', I disagree here too. About the only chink in the Braves' armor is that
they're weak offensively at several positions (CF, C, 2B, SS if Belliard
plays, 1B unless Bream and Hunter form another super-platoon) and very weak 
defensively if Blauser plays. I'd like to see the Braves give at least one of
Mel Nieves, Javy Lopez or Chipper Jones a shot, but much like the talent-rich
Jays of recent years they'll be conservative and stick with what they have. 
I'm not saying that's wrong, just conservative.

"The media is beating the incident at Dodger Stadium on Wednesday to
death, but I haven't seen anything in rsb yet.

Gerald Perry of the Cardinals pinch hit in the eighth inning with two
on and his club down by a run.  He stroked a line drive into the
right field corner.  The ball cleared the three-foot high fence and
went into the crowd.  Darryl, racing over from right center, got to
the spot in time to reach his glove up over the short fence, but he
missed the ball.  A fan sitting in the front row, wearing a mitt,
reached up and caught the ball.  Home run.

Now I've seen the replay several times and I have concluded that
Darryl missed the ball, and that the fan's glove was essentially
behind Darryl's.  Several Dodger fans with seats in the immediate
vicinity have claimed that the fan unquestionably interfered with
Strawberry.  What cannot be disputed, however, is that the fan
who caught the ball never took his eye off it;  he was oblivious
to where the fielder was playing.  He was also quite exuberant as
soon as he realized he had made the catch.

That exuberance disappeared immediately, however, when Strawberry
went into a tirade at the man.  All reports indicate he used a lot
of profanity and accused the man of interference, and therefore of
costing the Dodgers a game.  Shortly afterwards other fans hurled
food and beverages toward the man who made the catch.  Dodger Stadium
officials started to remove him from the park, but then relented and
just relocated him to another area.  In an interview after the game,
Lasorda blamed the fan for the loss.  Strawberry also went into a
tirade about how the fans are stupid and they don't care about 
winning.  L.A. Times columnists similarly blasted the man who made
the catch.

Before each Dodger game the public address announcer makes a speech
wherein he says that fans are welcome to the souvenirs of balls that
are hit into the stands as long as they do not interfere with any 
that are in the field of play.  Was the fan wrong?  Should he have
been more aware of the situation and acted to avoid any possibility
of interference?  Or was he human and just reacting?  By the way, he
is a season ticket holder and on his request the Dodgers have relocated
his seats to another area of the Stadium where future interference is
impossible.

Others have questioned why Darryl should be so concerned with what
the fan did when he has a grand total of 1 rbi through the first
nine games.

I question what he was doing in right center with a left-handed pull
hitter up and the game on the line.  Had he been closer to the play,
he certainly would have had a much better chance of catching the ball.

But I guess the big debate continues as to what are the responsibilities
of the fan.

Kovalev is too talented a player to play for Roger Nielson...Roger needs
players who can't think for themselves and can only skate in straight

Get Muckler as coach, and Kovalev will look like Mogilny.

The trouble with the Rangers is that Neil Smith went out and got
players like Messier, Kovalev, and Graves who have been schooled in
taking the game to their opponent and attacking, while hiring coaches

Just curious, Roger, but since you have such a vast knowledge of the

There must be a lot of demand for expertise in the field. I'm sure

Not necessarily.  It could mean that, or it could mean that he just hit
a lot better at home than he did on the road (see Frank Thomas' home/road
splits in '91 for an example).  I would guess that some of Alomar's split
is due to the Skydome, but most of it is probably due just to coincidence.
There's no way to be sure, of course, but the only hitters the Skydome
seems to regularly help a lot are right handed home run hitters, and
Alomar is not a home run hitter.


Only because of t&P's bogus fielding stats, which rate Alomar as the worst
defensive second baseman in the league.  On a career basis, I think T&P's
fielding stats may mean something, but on a seasonal basis it comes up
with ridiculous results like this.  Alomar may not be the god of fielding
the media says he is, but he sure isn't the worst in baseball.

Offensively, T&P rate Alomar much higher last year.

Regarding the A vs. B argument, I'll just say they're both very good players
with different strengths and a bright future.

There is really nothing inherently wrong with it but they tried it just
a little over a decade ago, and noone showed up for the early rounds in
the playoffs...whereas soon after they went to the divisional set-up
arenas were mostly filled in the early rounds.  

The empirical evidence of the last two decades is that more people will
show up to see the Bruins play the Sabre umpteen times than see the
Bruins play the Captials in the first round.

Maybe hockey has increased in popularity sufficiently that this will
no longer be the case.  The experiment is worthwhile with the uneven
distribution of the expansion teams, but I prefer the divisional 
playoff.",sports

            ...


Why do you say this?  As of now, the Pens and Bruins have played the
same number of games, and given up the same number of goals.  They are
tied for the third and fourth best defenses in the league, behind
Chicago first and Toronto second.  The Pens' weak spot is defense?  Only
by comparison to their offense, which is second in the league to
Detroit.  But the Pens are no weaker on defense and goaltending than the
Bruins are; that is, they are both very strong.

Buffalo seems to have started a tradition of trading its captains.

Pat LaFontaine was awarded the Captaincy when Mike Ramsey was forced
to give it up (Ramsey's now a Penguin).  Ramsey inherited it from Mike
Foligno (who's now a leaf).  He in turn had inherited it from Lindy
Ruff, who went I forget where.  Ruff had it from Perreault, who
retired, so I guess that's where the streak started.  Or did it?
After all, Danny Gare was captain before him, and he went to Detroit.
Jim Scoenfeld, Gerry Meehan, and Floyd Smith are the others, in
reverse order, last to first.  I was a bit young at the time, so I'm
not sure of the fate of Schoenfeld, but he ultimately went to Detroit
and Boston.  Meehan went to Vancouver, Atlanta and Washington.  Smith
seems to have hung up his skates after Buffalo, but I don't know if
the captaincy was removed before or after that, or how many games he
played for Buffalo.  This is actually getting fascinating.  :-)

Captaincy in Buffalo is a sure sign you're to be traded, almost,
unless you're a franchise player.

"The term ""stopper"" is generally used to refer to a pitcher, one
who can be counted on to pitch a strong game to keep his team from going
on a losing streak.

	The Braves have plenty of pitchers to fit this description,
although right now I'd expect Smoltz or Glavine to take the mantle.

	What the Braves lack, however, is an offensive stopper,
somebody they can look to to bring them out of their hitting slump.
There's just no one there.  The Braves got rid of their best pure
hitter, Lonnie Smith, and only Terry Pendleton on the current roster
has ever shown more than a cursory ability to hit.

"Well, the Patrick Division got a little more interesting last night. 
The Islanders lost in OT and the Devils tied the Pens.  That means if the Isles
beat the Devils on Friday, the will meet the Caps in the playoffs.

	However, I have some more comments on the Islanders and hockey in
general that I need to get off my chest :).  First of all, with the Islanders 
back-to-back lackluster performances against the Whalers, one may think that 
the Islanders are out of shape.  These guys always suck wind in the 2nd period,
come on a little in the 3rd and run out of gas too soon.  It is unbelieveable
how many one goal games these guys have lost.  Anyway, the games was pretty 
wide open.  The Isles still have tons of trouble scoring.  The Whalers played 
a golie in is 1st NHL start, I think his name was Lenarduzzi (sp?).  (His NHL 
debut was the Tuesday tie against the Isles).  Like I mentioned before, this 
guy looked like the best golie on the planet for a while (until he misplayed a 
Mahlakov slap shot to go to OT).  I say it's because the Isles don't shoot 
correctly.  Has anyone else noticed this?

	Also, I think it is really a shame for hockey when I guy like Mick
Vukota gets as much ice time as he does.  This guy has about as much hockey
talent as Jiggs MacDonald (who did play hockey, I think).  Anytime he gets the
puck it gets stolen, and he always starts fights and gets needless penalties. 
Richard Pilon is another guy who is on the ice to stir up crap.  And he's a
defenseman.  He's got to be approaching negative infinity for his plus/minus. 
This guy gets beaten all the time.  Why the need for such ""enforcers""?  Not
only do fights slow the game down ALOT, but it takes away from the guys who are
really trying to play the game.  I'll be one of the few to admit, I do enjoy a 
good fight once in a while, but only when it's ""called for"".  You know, when a
guy checks the goalie too hard.  In other words, a violation of ""hockey ethics""
might cause you to get puched.  But there is no need to start crap when you are
losing or becuase you can get away with it!! Does anyone agree that referees
need to be a little less lenient in the 3rd and OT?  I mean COME ON already. 
I'm sick of seeing teams pulling guys down, holding guys etc. just becuase the
referee doesn't call it.  OT and late in the 3rd should be a time for strategy,
not physical prowess.  Trying to set up a goal should be first and foremost. 
If you are so afraid that the other team is going to score that you have to
pull a guy down to prevent it, you don't deserve to win in the first place.

Just My Honest Opinion,",sports
"Tom Barrasso wore a great mask, one time, last season.  He unveiled it
at a game in Boston.  

It was all black, with Pgh city scenes on it.  The ""Golden Triangle""
(Pgh's downtown area where the 3 rivers meet) graced the top, along
with a steel mill on one side and the Civic Arena (I think) on the 
other.   On the back of the helmet was the old Pens' logo (the really
fat little penguin with the blue scarf) the current (at the time) Pens
logo, and a space for the ""new"" (now current) logo.

Tommy had designed the mask, and his mother (an artist) painted it
for him.  

But while wearing the mask, the Pens got thumped by the Bruins.  The
very next game, Tommy was back to the old paint job.  A great mask
done in by a goalie's superstition.",sports
"

The Leafs have always been kind of comical.  During the second  Imlach
era, when Darryl Sittler was called a ""cancer on the team"", he tore the
C off his sweater and for a while the Leafs didn't have a Captain.

Sittler eventually ended up in Philly and he was promised  the  Philly
captaincy  by  new  GM  (and Sittler's friend) Bobby Clarke.  Instead,
Sittler got traded to Detroit.

Rick Vaive was the Leaf Captain for awhile but he slept in one day and
they took the captaincy away from him.  Then he was traded to Chicago.

During Doug Carpenter's tenure as Leaf coach, in an  attempt  to  kiss
the  ass of a sulking Gary Leeman, the Leafs took the A away from Brad
Marsh to give to Leeman.  Leeman wouldn't take it and when they  tried
to give it back to Marsh, he wouldn't take it neither.

The best story I remember about a captain concerned Mel Bridgman, late
of the Senators.  While he was in Philadelphia, Bobby Clarke, arguably
one of the great captains of all time, was bumped up to the status  of
playing coach and so he had to relinquish the captaincy.  Bridgman be-
came the new captain.  A reporter asked a Flyer what Bridgman did as a
captain  since  Clarke  was  still  the  undisputed leader amongst the
players.  The reporter was told that Bridgman was in charge of  making
sure that the soap dispensers in the showers were always full.

        Well as for team captains being traded
        in there first year in the NHL the
        Edmonton Oilers traded their captain
        Ron Chiperfield to the Quebec Nordique
        right at the trading deadline for 
        Goaltender Ron Lowe
        In their second year of existence
        The Edmonton Oilers again right at the trade 
        deadline traded their captain, this time 
        B.J. McDonald to the Vancouver Canucks
        along with the rights to winger Ken 
        Berry for Garry Lariviere and the rights 
        to Lars Gunner Petterson 
        
        as for more captain trivia, the next Edmonton
        captain was Lee Fogilin who was later traded to
        the Buffalo Sabres, after him was Wayne Gretzky
        who was traded to L A, then came Kevin Low who
        only this year was traded to the N Y Rangers
        so that every captain the Edmonton Oilers have had
        has been traded.

        The present captain is Craig McTavish and we'll
        just have to wait and see.


        well talk to you later

trade to Toronto????   Sheeeesh!  You should have waited until we got
over that one before this garbage, maybe we would have believed it for
half a second (NOT!).

   By the way, I just heard from Mother Goose that Mario Lemieux was
traded to Winnpeg for Tie Domi!!!!!

About 25 is correct for Numminen and Lumme.



No, Kurri's points are too low. 27 for Kurri and 28 for Sel{nne.




That's true. Game is so different here in Europe compared to NHL. North-ame-
ricans are better in small rinks and europeans in large rinks. An average
european player from Sweden, Finland, Russian or Tsech/Slovakia is a better 
skater and  puckhandler than his NHL colleague. Especially defenders in NHL
are mainly slow and clumsy. Sel{nne has also said that in the Finnish Sm-league
game is more based on skill than in NHL. In Finland he couldn't get so many 
breakaways because defenders here are an average much better skaters than in
NHL. Also Alpo Suhonen said that in NHL Sel{nne's speed accentuates because
of clumsy defensemen.

I have to admit that the best players come from Canada, but those regulars
aren't as skilful as regulars in the best european leagues. Also top europeans
are in the same level as the best north-americans.(except Lemieux is in the
class of his own). ",sports

That last was me, Steve Novak.  I've since read the entire original
posting by Hite.

Mr. Fischer was actually restrained.  Let Mr. Hite hope he never makes
some similar, tiny mistake.
",sports
"
",sports
"

I watched him over his entire career.  I have NEVER seen a player, and that
includes Russell Courtnall and Davie Keon, screw up as many breakaways as
Bob Gainey.  And I will never forget the time Denis Potvin caught Gainey
with his head down.  You have been sold a bill of goods on Bob Gainey.

Gainey was a plugger.  And when the press runs out of things to say about 
the stars on dynasties they start to hype the pluggers.  Grant Fuhr, Essa
Tikkannen, Butch Goring, Bob Nystrom, Bob Gainey, Doug Jarvis, Derek
Sanderson, Wayne Cashman, Bob Baun, Bob Pulford, Ralph Backstrom, Henri
Richard, Dick Duff...and so on...

"Jesus Christ!!!

The score is now 6-0. The Pens are beating the shit out of the Devils who
gave up in the middle of the 2nd period. ESPN does something smart. The
announcer states ""well folks this game is getting out of hand. Lets go to
the Islander/Capitals game."" I celebrate as I was actually making progress in
my CS homework because I was so bored by the scheduled game.  I tear down and
throw on my jersey, Hunter scores I go ape shit 'cause this is the first
caps game I've been able to watch all season. And what does ESPN do? they
go back to the blowout that NJ hasn't a chance in hell of winning!
     The period ends and the sportscaster (CAPITOLS JUST TIED IT UP!! YES!!
oops excuse me =) goes into his penguin worship mode (Dont freak pens fans!
They are worthy of this! I'm so glad we wont have to play them as much next
year!) and here comes the 3rd period...what? its the blowout again. Oh they
were just waiting for the Cap/Isles to get out of intermission. Good
they've put a close game back on. Wait! WHATS THIS SHIT?!! THEY'RE SHOWING
THE BLOWOUT AGAIN!


AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG!

(Oh guess what the score is now 7-0 penguins! Switch games you $%&*#@!!!)

Holy shit they're changing games! ITS ABOUT GODDAMNED TIME!! Lets see if
they'll stay.

Later

I think this proves by $#%&* point. The Caps game goes into overtime but
""due to contractual obligations"" they have to switch to the fucking baseball.

if their scheduled game went into overtime? ESPN get your head out of your

Question:
If a team uses 40 players in a season do you merely divide the total +/-
by 40?  If so, a player who plays in only 1 game is considered equally
valuable as a player who plays in all of them.


Since the standard deviation for each team is different, I am unsure how 
""transferable"" between teams that these stats are.  Shouldn't the average
standard deviation in the league be used?

I am interested in seeing each method.
But I still think that mine is the best. If for no other reason than familiarity.",sports

"The Dodgers have been shopping Harris to other teams in their
quest for more left-handed pitching.  So far, no takers.
Personally, I think Harris is a defensive liability, and he
has also led the team in past years for hitting into double
plays, or at least been among the leaders.
 
Sharperson showed last year that if given a chance to play
every day, he can get the job done.  If Sharpy played just
one base every day, say third, he'd also improve defensively.
 
Wallach has helped tremendously on defense, as has Reed.
The improved defense is quite noticeable and is having an
effect on the pitching staff.  Both Astacio AND Martinez
were bailed out in recent starts by great defensive plays.
Martinez pitched into the ninth in a game that might
have seen him lifted in the third in past years.
 
Astacio lasted 7 innings the other day under similar circumstances.
The Dodgers are turning double plays, and keeping more balls
in the infield than last year.  And Piazza has also been great
on defense.  He has thrown out 10 of 14 batters trying to
steal and has at least one pick off at first.
 
Wallach, clearly, has contributed to the over all improvement on
defense.  But his offense is awful and he has cost the Dodgers
some runs.  But I don't think he is as bad as his current average.
I suspect he will come out of this slump much as Davis and Straw
seem to have come out of theirs.",sports
"

I'm not quite sure how these numbers are generated.  It appears that in
a neutral park Bo's HR and slugging tend to drop (he actually loses two
home runs).  Or do they?  What is ""equivalent average?""

One thing, when looking at Bo's stats, is that you can see that KC took
away some homers.  Normally, you expect some would-be homers to go for
doubles or triples in big parks, or to be caught, and for that matter you
expect lots of doubles and triples anyway.  But Bo, despite his speed, 
hit very few doubles and not that many triples.  So I would expect his
value to have risen quite considerably in a neutral park.  


Felix Jose has been a .350/.440 player in a fairly neutral park.
I would offhand guess the `89-`90 Bo at around a .330/.530 player.
Maybe .330/.550 .  Not even close.


I'd put him about there too.  

Note: I hadn't realized the media had hyped him so much.  I thought he
was always viewed by them as a better football player, and only so-so 
at baseball.  He did only have one 30-hr, 100-rbi season, and KC wasn't
winning.

Note 2: I maybe have harped on this a bit in the past, but there is a
mistake being made (by the SDCN's, as they are known, on this group)
with respect to players like Bo and Deion and Lofton (and perhaps others).

We find, that if you look at a large group of players, their past major
and minor league numbers will predict their future numbers fairly well.
Their are some caveats: the younger they are, the less good the prediction;
the lower the minor league, the less good (I imagine), the more recent
the player has left college ball, etc.

Now of course, this prediction involves quite a bit of ""error.""  Sometimes
a player with poor MLE's (Dave Justice, the 1990 Ventura) becomes a star.
Some hitters develop (Shane Mack, Brian Downing), some don't (Oddibe
McDowell, Mickey Brantley).  This error involves real things: there are
real reasons why Oddibe didn't hit and Shane did.  It may (who knows)
involve parks and batting coaches and wheaties and injuries and lifting
and so on.

But still, you have this big pool of players, and things work pretty well.
One of the reasons for these predictions accuracy is the common background
of the players.  One thing we know about professional baseball players is
that all of them (or almost all) have spent a good deal of time playing
ball.  Their backgrounds are similar.

What hasn't been established is what happens when you encounter a player
with a different background?  Is there some reason to believe that a
Bo, or a Deion, or a Lofton, or a Tony Gwynn (?), or an Ainge, or so
on, has such a different background, that the standard model and standard
assumptions fit this person slowly?

It hasn't been established that you can use MLE's with two-sport players.
(It hasn't been established that you can't, but then statistics is, after
all, an art).  I personally think otherwise lucid individuals continually
make completely nonsensical statements about Bo and Deion and Lofton.
""Look at those good-but-not-great minor league numbers,"" they say.  Well,
what happens if those numbers simply don't mean what they usually mean?
It might mean that Ken Lofton suddenly has a better year in Houston than
Tuscon.  It might mean that Deion suddenly has a better half-year in
Atlanta than Greenville.  

Then again, it might not.  Ken and Deion might go right back in the tank
this year, live up to those poor MLE's.  But you guys DON'T KNOW.  What's 
worse, you don't know that you don't.  And you don't know that there are 
other players you won't know about -- injuries and lifting and wheaties 
again.  You seem to think that the model is perfect and eternal.  It's not.
It's got some error.

Oh well.

"once at the secret desert base , there is a long chop-socky sequence , followed by the film's centerpiece , a wind-tunnel fight that's even better than the one in face/off .",movie

"this little-known story of this meteoric rise and fall is told my international filmmaker raoul peck in "" lumumba . """,movie
"patrice lumumba's ( eriq ebouaney ) story has been told previously by helmer peck in his 1991 award winning documentary , "" lumumba - death of a prophet , "" virtually guaranteeing that his new , fictional account of a patriot remains true to its subject .",movie
"peck , with co-writer pascal bonitzer , begins at the end of the story of the young political leader .",movie

"a third class postal worker , lumumba , speaks his mind to heads of the most powerful tribes , proclaiming himself not tribal , not regional , but a national leader .",movie
"his small , mobile party , the congolese national movement ( mnc ) is gaining prominence and patrice leaves his clerical job to sell beer , and get his face known , in the bustling capital , stanleyville .",movie
"at a time when the colonial empires are falling down around the world , lumumba is in the right place at the right time and , through political savvy and chess-like manipulation , achieves a position of leadership of the mnc .",movie
"as the date for independence approaches , he tactically positions himself to be the new nation's first prime minister and defense minister , supporting the presidency of joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto ) .",movie
"the coalition he created soon starts to fall apart as the former belgian masters continue to exert influence on the struggling nation as they strive to maintain economic hold on the country's vast natural resources of copper , diamonds , gold and more .",movie
"lumumba won't seek the help of the us , knowing that they would try to create de facto american control of the fledgling government .",movie
his initial investigation into soviet assistance immediately tags patrice as a communist and his integrity is overshadowed by the cold war threat of russian domination .,movie
"the situation goes from bad to worse as the army mutinies , the remaining whites begin to evacuate or arm themselves , belgian troops violently intervene , the lucrative katanga province succeeds under the leadership of rival moise tschombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and lumumba is refused access to his own country when he returns from a conference abroad .",movie
this tumultuous and little known period of modern african history saw a score of nations struggling for independence from the sometimes-odious colonialists who have ruled much of the world from their european seats of power for centuries .,movie
"peck focuses his story on familiar material that strives to give an honest portrayal of patrice lumumba , his friend and foes and the independence movements that gripped africa in the 50's and 60's .",movie
"( during the time the story takes place , many new nations , including nigeria and somalia , were born , with varying degrees of success and failure , usually dependent upon which country colonized them .",movie
some colonial masters were better than others . ),movie
"the effort involved in "" lumumba "" is quite ambitious as peck and his crew before and behind the camera strive to bring to life this slice of world history that might have gone unexplored for decades , if at all .",movie
"production values are first rate on what must be a small , by us standards , budget .",movie
the period feel and realistic african settings are nicely maintained in a production that traveled from zimbabwe to mozambique .,movie
the screenplay covers a lot of ground and does yeoman's work in providing a great deal of detailed history while trying to do justice to the story of lumumba's life .,movie
"the political side of things is evenly told in a linear , straightforward manner that teaches , not preaches .",movie
"it concentrates on the good deeds of the man , if a bit as a stalwart saint , but doesn't embellish on a larger than life persona .",movie
"the family side of patrice's life is handled in several , perfunctory and brief interludes that show him talking to one of his children , embracing his wife or lamenting the death of his child .",movie
"i know the intent is to flesh the man out , but too short a shrift is given to the family man side of lumumba .",movie
"the story , as such , has a lopsided feel about it .",movie
high marks go to eriq ebouaney as the title character .,movie
"the actor gives a convincing , charismatic performance as the multifaceted , politically deft patrice lumumba who has the good of his people and his country as the force driving his own ambitions .",movie
"in true docudrama tradition , the supporting cast does not outshine the star , complementing his good efforts , instead .",movie
""" lumumba "" is a solid , interesting , educational and honest docudrama that should appeal to film buffs and politicos , both .",movie
it has more intelligence in its telling than anything i've seen out of hollywood for months and i give it a b+ .,movie
"apparently , director tony kaye had a major battle with new line regarding his new film , american history x . i don't know the details of the fight , but it seems that he is not happy with the final product , and nearly removed his name from the credits altogether .",movie
"i've heard about this kind of thing happening before , and it makes me wonder how much input a studio has over the films they produce .",movie
"as it is , i found american history x to be an extremely good film , not just because of tony kaye's focused look at the touchy subject of racism , but because of a powerful , charismatic performance from edward norton .",movie
"it's hard to believe that it has only been two years since norton's fantastic role in primal fear , but , here he is now , starring in his own film and making himself a star .",movie
"norton is one of those performers who becomes his character , and his work in american history x is one of the very best performances this year .",movie
"he plays a young man named derek vinyard , a skinhead living in venice beach with his brother , danny ( edward furlong ) , mother ( beverly d'angelo ) , and sister , davin ( jennifer lien ) .",movie
"the film opens with a flashback , in which derek brutally kills two black men vandalizing his car .",movie
"we find out that this lands him in prison , and the film from that point is seen through the eyes of danny .",movie
"in the present-time of the film , danny is in high school , and eager to follow the footsteps of his brother .",movie
"much of the film is told in flashback , and we see the path that leads to derek's adoption of white supremacy .",movie
"when derek is released , having served three years in prison , he finds that his brother is now a full-blown skinhead ; derek , however , has given up the violence , and tries to get his brother to understand why racism and the violence that comes with it are bad things .",movie
"what makes this all interesting is that these two young men are not stupid , thoughtless people -- they are intelligent and articulate , and voice their beliefs in disturbingly straightforward terms .",movie
"it's hard to make a controversial movie and not preach , but kaye has found the right note for his material .",movie
"because american history x is a mainstream film , there has to be a redemption phase for our main character -- some people may think that this is the only way to make him sympathetic .",movie
"i partially disagree with this , because , although i do not advocate racism in any way , it's interesting the way kaye presents derek -- he is a loud , obnoxious man , but he's also very smart .",movie
the reasons for why he becomes a skinhead are believable -- his father was arbitrarily killed by a group of black men .,movie
"it's clear that he's passionate about his beliefs , and that he's not just a punk looking for an excuse to beat people up .",movie
"of course , it helps that kaye has an actor as talented as norton to play this part .",movie
it's astonishing how frightening norton looks with a shaved head and a swastika on his chest .,movie
"in addition to getting the look just right , he's perfect for this role -- derek requires intelligence , depth , and a whole lot of shouting , and norton does it all with ease .",movie
"even when he's at his meanest , derek has a likable quality to him , and that's a gutsy approach when telling a story about a skinhead .",movie
what adds depth to the story is a subplot in which the principal of danny's school ( avery brooks ) becomes obsessed with purging the hatred from danny .,movie
"the other performances are all terrific , with standouts from furlong , d'angelo , and lien .",movie
"visually , the film is very powerful .",movie
"kaye indulges in a lot of interesting artistic choices , and most of them work nicely -- lots of slow-motion and strange camera angles add to a moody atmosphere .",movie
"but , like a lot of movies lately , american history x skims past greatness in the last few minutes .",movie
"although the climactic scene is very moving , the picture ends with a pretentious , preachy resolution featuring a brief narration from a character who was killed .",movie
"for a movie so smart a subtle up until that point , it felt like a slap in the face to be hand-fed a theme in such a simplistic way .",movie
"it makes me wonder what , exactly , tony kaye disliked about the final version of his film .",movie
perhaps this last scene was the problem .,movie
"it's hard to imagine any director not being at least partially pleased with a film this good -- in a time when so many movies are timid and weak , american history x manages to make a compelling argument for racism without advocating it any way .",movie
one of my colleagues was surprised when i told her i was willing to see betsy's wedding .,movie
and she was shocked to hear that i actually liked it .,movie
"her reaction was understandable when you consider that the film revolves around molly ringwald , who hasn't made a worthwhile film since 1986 .",movie
"but the fact is , betsy's wedding is also an alan alda film .",movie
"and while ringwald has been making duds for the last four years , alda has been involved with several noteworthy projects , including crimes and misdemeanors and a new life .",movie
"written and directed by alda , betsy's wedding is a vibrant slice-of-life , mixing a few dramatic moments into a big bowl of whimsical humor .",movie
alda's comic elixir is smooth and refreshing--and a welcome change of pace from the usual summer fare .,movie
"as bride and groom , molly ringwald and dylan walsh are the pivotal characters in the film , but they are by far the least interesting .",movie
"walsh is a nonentity , with all the screen presence of a door knob .",movie
ringwald is simply unbearable and is easily the weakest link in the chain .,movie
"she looks hideous with her short-cropped orange hair , red lip-stick and grotesque outfits .",movie
"she's supposed to be a dress designer , but she looks more like a clown .",movie
"and to make matters worse , ringwald's performance matches her appearance .",movie
"thankfully , alda keeps ringwald's screen time to a minimum ; he is far more interested in the colorful periphery characters .",movie
"the wedding is just a device to bring together the bride's working-class , italian family and the groom's rich , gentile family .",movie
"ringwald's folks are homey and down-to-earth , with alda as her free-spirited father , madeline kahn as her practical mother , and ally sheedy as her lonely sister .",movie
"walsh's clan , on the other hand , is prim , proper and ostentatious .",movie
"when the two families meet and mingle , the movie becomes a story of culture clash , or as one character puts it , "" money versus values . """,movie
"ally sheedy , in a wonderfully understated performance , is one of the film's most pleasant surprises .",movie
sheedy expresses more with just her eyes than ringwald does with her entire body .,movie
"it's anthony lapaglia , however , who seizes the spotlight .",movie
"lapaglia plays stevie dee , a suave , overly polite mafioso who is formally courting sheedy with old-fashioned chivalry .",movie
lapaglia's sincere but dim-witted character is a riot .,movie
"and what's uncanny is that lapaglia is a dead ringer for robert de niro , with a little bit of alec baldwin thrown in for good measure .",movie
"lapaglia seems to have attended the de niro school of gangster acting , and his inspired performance is partly a tribute to his role-model and partly a rip-off .",movie
"i don't know whether to say a star is born or a star is re-born , but i do know that lapaglia's over-the-top performance should not be missed .",movie
"the scrumptious comic acting , however , extends well beyond sheedy and lapaglia .",movie
"joe pesci , in particular , sinks his teeth into his role as alda's unscrupulous brother-in-law , a slum lord with mob ties , who is cheating on his wife ( catherine o'hara ) .",movie
"alda , faced with challenge of both directing and acting , somehow finds just the right comic touch as the bride's financially-strapped father , a carpenter whose dreams are bigger than his wallet .",movie
"the film adopts alda's psychological point of view as he tries to one : plan the wedding , and two : pay for it .",movie
"as a filmmaker , alda's style of humor is remarkably restrained and tasteful .",movie
"and while he doesn't have the comic genius of a woody allen , alda does possess the inspiration to make movies which are ten times more entertaining than the slop which usually passes for comedy .",movie
"after bloody clashes and independence won , lumumba refused to pander to the belgians , who continued a condescending and paternalistic relationship with the congo .",movie
"their officers , particularly general janssens ( rudi delhem ) in the force publique , the congo's army , caused rebellions , undermining lumumba , who was outraged at the rape and murder of belgian nationals .",movie
"with unrest building , moise tshombe ( pascal nzonzi ) and the province of katanga , which contained 70 percent of the country's resources , proclaimed secession .",movie
"lumumba replaced janssens , making mobutu a colonel , and went on a pacification",movie
"tour with congolese president joseph kasa vubu ( maka kotto ) , but it was too late .",movie
"'when you want to drown a dog , you say it has rabies , ' prophesies lumumba of his own fate .",movie
"peck and bonitzer do an exemplary job telling a complicated tale with a myriad of players , although they frequently succumb to cliche , particularly regarding lumumba's private life .",movie
"peck's script illuminates bantu sayings like 'the hand that gives , rules' when lumumba uses it with the american ambassador .",movie
"peck's direction is less assured , with many scenes unfortunately playing like standard television fare .",movie
"he's served well , though , by his casting of ebouaney in the title role .",movie
"ebouaney is dynamic , radiating his character's fierce passion for his people and his country .",movie
"lumumba's intelligence and ability to strategize , even as he's cornered by insurmountable odds , are given life by ebouaney .",movie
peck's subject and lead actor elevate his film above its mediocre production .,movie
""" lumumba "" is a story that deserves to be told and ebouaney's performance makes the tragedy personally felt .",movie
the american action film has been slowly drowning to death in a sea of asian wire-fu copycats .,movie
"it's not a pretty death , and it's leaving the likes of schwartznager , stallone , and van damme wearing cement galoshes at the bottom of a kung fu sea .",movie
"sometimes , the mix results in a mind-blowing spectacle unlike any other .",movie
"quality action with amazing and exciting stunt work , as in 1999's the matrix , can be a real gem .",movie
"but too often hollywood gets it wrong , even when they pay off chinese directors .",movie
flying ninjas and floating karate masters have been replaced by soaring bronx detectives and slow motion kicking scientists .,movie
mostly it's laughable .,movie
"in hollywood's rush to emulate the success of the matrix , trademark asian stunt choreography has become more of a joke than an art form .",movie
"but iron monkey , the latest asian import , shows us how to get it right .",movie
"iron monkey ( actually a reissue of a 1993 film ) is the story of a 19th chinese vigilante ( rongguang yu ) , fighting with his own unique style of shaolin kung fu for the rights of the oppressed and the bellies of the hungry .",movie
"but it is also a piece of the narrative of legendary chinese film hero wong fei-hong , most recently seen in one of the most overlooked , and possibly best films of 2000 , drunken master 2 ( released in the u . s . as the legend of drunken master ) .",movie
"unlike drunken master 2 , which stars jackie chan as an adult fei-hong , iron monkey finds a much younger fei-hong ( sze-man tsang ) and his father wong kei-ying ( yen chi dan ) thrust into the middle of iron monkey's fight against oppression .",movie
"iron monkey succeeds as no kung fu film since drunken master 2 . at times , fighting styles , especially that of monkey himself , do devolve into the ridiculous twinkle-toed floating of films like crouching tiger , hidden dragon , director yuen wo ping eventually remembers to bring his action scenes back to earth .",movie
"iron monkey is at its heart a hardcore , kung fu action film rather than any kind of drama a la crouching tiger .",movie
"however , there are brief moments of profoundness shared between characters , such as those that pass between our outlaw hero and his good-hearted but misguided enemy , chief fox .",movie
"in those moments , and in others , iron monkey manages to transcend its mindless kung fu nature to touch the hearts and minds of its audience .",movie
"while in no way the equal of a masterpiece like drunken master 2 , iron monkey dances quite nicely to the invading kung fu tune .",movie

"it had a lot going for it , but somewhere along the way , it faltered .",movie
"somehow , underneath the seemingly poetic beauty of it all , there was a gigantic hole somebody covered with iridescent performances and glossy cinematography .",movie
the predictable ending that shattered our hopes ( even though we saw it coming ) only added to the disappointment .,movie
"but for over an hour , city of angels is well worth the time .",movie
"nicolas cage is seth , a guardian angel who , like hundreds ( likely thousands or even millions ) of other angels , spends eternity watching over the citizens of mortality ; humans never aware of how much celestial intervention occurs in their life .",movie

"angels , who we quickly learn are not and never were humans , can not experience human sensations such as taste and touch , but they do have the ability to make themselves seen to anyone they desire .",movie
"seth's adoration is too much to resist , and eventually he does appear to maggie , quite regularly , although such a thing seems taboo among the angelic community .",movie
"the angels are interestingly presented , all of them dressed in black and more reminiscent of hitmen than traditional glowing white entities , but it's a nice touch that never seems like a mere attempt at uniqueness .",movie
"cage is a wonderfully versatile actor ( think face/off , raising arizona , and it could happen to you - what a combo ! ) who slips into the role of a heavenly agent quite nicely but threatens sappiness more than once .",movie
it's nice to see ryan pick up roles like this and the one in courage under fire .,movie
"the two aren't very comparable to each other , but they both deviate from her usual "" intelligently ditzy "" romantic comedy roles , and it's an impressive side of ryan movie goers rarely have the chance to enjoy .",movie
"but even though the two leads do an impressive job , it is dennis franz who grabs us with his interpretation of a hospital patient who knows more than meets the eye .",movie
"it's a shame that with so much going for it , city of angels falters so much in its final stages , leaving us with the realization that an emotionally incredible movie was out there , they just didn't know quite how to get to it .",movie
they struggle for an impacting conclusion and wind up with painful thud rather than an exhilarating high .,movie
"filmmakers should know your final impression will be the one you linger on , remember , and convey to others thru word of mouth , so after telling us for 60+ minutes that this film is a glorious masterpiece , they sure leave us with a disheartening taste of mediocrity in our mouths .",movie
"based on the german film wings of desire ( that being the english title , of course ) , city of angels is ninety percent success , enough to make most people forgive its shortcomings , even the devastatingly disappointing ending .",movie
"most movie goers , the non-cynics anyway , will be too wrapped up in the surreal atmosphere to give criticism to that which needs to be criticized .",movie

"like "" stand by me "" , this is a mostly character-driven film , and as such it benefits greatly from superb casting .",movie
"yelchin is very good as bobby , finding a good mix of innocence and resignation .",movie
"more splendid still is boorem , whom i praised highly for her work in "" along came a spider "" and who is simply radiant here as carol .",movie
"and then there is hopkins , who despite playing such a quiet , introspective character as ted , nonetheless commands our attention every time he is onscreen .",movie
"less successful is davis , whose strident elizabeth comes across as overly cartoonish .",movie
"i also found it odd that bobby and carol's other friend , sully ( whose death as an adult sets up the movie's flashback framing device ) , is paid virtually no attention .",movie

"synopsis : in this movie , steven spielberg , one of today's finest directors , attempts to spice up the 1800s story of a long courtroom battle over the fate of prisoner cinque ( djimon hounsou ) - - a young angry man from sierra leone who was kidnapped into slavery - - and his fellow prisoners .",movie
"cinque and friends have landed a ship on the shores of america after escaping spanish slave traders , but since the americans don't speak cinque's language , the black men are hauled into court to determine whether or not they are legally slaves .",movie

"lawyers baldwin and adams ( matthew mcconaughey and anthony hopkins ) must prove cinque and the others were captured into slavery , rather than born slaves , in order to get them out of prison as free men .",movie

"lives are often at stake , and the criminal is usually armed and most likely mentally unstable , prone to turn on the negotiator at a moment's notice .",movie
"the negotiator must therefore be something of an actor , psychologist , and sham artist , in addition to being a police officer ; he must be able to think on his feet and either work toward the goal of ending the confrontation without violence , or failing that , must be prepared to facilitate the conclusion of the crisis through firepower .",movie
"most of all , the negotiator must be able to enter a situation with as little intelligence about the scenario as possible , and quickly gain control of the situation , dominate the conversation , and influence the perpetrator into thinking that the end of the conflict is what he really wants .",movie
it takes a pretty smart person to do that .,movie
but what if the hostage-holding criminal is just as smart ?,movie
what if he's also able to think on his feet ?,movie
"in fact , what if he also knows all the tricks to turning the situation to his favor ?",movie
it is this circumstance which forms the basis for f . gary gray's the negotiator .,movie
"in this film , police negotiator danny roman ( samuel l . jackson ) is tipped off by his partner to corruption within the chicago police force .",movie
"when his partner turns up shot to death and internal affairs finds incriminating evidence in roman's home , roman becomes the prime suspect of both embezzling from the police disability fund and murder .",movie
"faced with the scorn of most of the police department , and under close scrutiny by the media , roman is forced to turn in his badge in one of those typical scenes in the captain's office .",movie
"i don't quite remember if the captain actually said , "" i hate to do this , but . . . "" ,",movie
although it wouldn't surprise me if he did .,movie
"luckily , the film soon shakes off the conventionalism and concentrates on the interesting premise mentioned above .",movie
"after being offered a take-it-or-leave-it deal by the district attorney , roman resolves to prove his innocence by walking into the office of internal affairs inspector niebaum ( j . t .",movie
"walsh ) , taking him and others hostage , and proclaiming he has been framed .",movie
"although roman's actions seem forced due to the compressed nature of his motivational build-up , gray redeems himself by involving us with the negotiations between roman and fellow police negotiator chris sabian ( kevin spacey ) which soon ensue .",movie
"jackson , while a superb actor , is miscast in the role of roman .",movie
"the actor has become so popular , and so often identified as a protagonist ( notable exceptions can be found , such as in jackie brown ) , that we as an audience have a difficult time believing he will carry out his threats .",movie
the script also clearly sets him up as the good guy who is only trying to prove his innocence .,movie
"how can we believe he's going to shoot a hostage , no matter if the hostage tried to kill him earlier ?",movie
"unfortunately , this preconception saps the film of some of it's would-be suspenseful moments , and anything good left in those scenes is largely attributed to jackson's acting ability .",movie
"almost every time he's in a scene , jackson steals it without looking back .",movie
"when spacey appears , the film has already run about a third of its course .",movie
his is an interesting character .,movie
"made out to be some kind of negotiating superman , our first look at him has him hopelessly trying to get his family moving to set out on vacation .",movie
""" i can talk a man out of blowing up the sears tower , but i can't talk my wife out of the bedroom or my daughter off the phone , "" he says .",movie
"when he gets the call to action , however , he quickly changes gears and becomes the man we expect him to be .",movie
"soon , his character has to negotiate not only with roman , but also with the swat commander ( david morse ) who is itching to send in a team to take roman out , all the while keeping wary of the fbi agents who are waiting to take over the operation , should negotiations fail .",movie
this complex set of pressures are reflected well in sabian the negotiator and spacey the actor .,movie
"as the second protagonist , spacey measures up nicely .",movie
gray really lucked out with this cast .,movie
"david morse as commander beck , ron rifkin as commander frost , and john spencer as police chief al travis are all more than competent , and can hold their own in scenes with jackson and spacey .",movie
"the only problem is the bit of typecasting that results from these choices : morse played a similar role in the rock , rifkin played the d . a .",movie
"in l . a . confidential , and spencer played a police detective in cop land .",movie
"with the level of acting , however , this can be forgiven .",movie
"also in the supporting cast , paul giamatti as rudy , one of the hostages , is notable for the comic relief he provides .",movie
"his character is initially so slimy , and giamatti himself just looks so shifty , that you expect to laugh before he even says anything .",movie
"fortunately , this doesn't distract from the seriousness of the rest of the film , but instead provides some nice breathers from the level of tension which gray manages to sustain throughout .",movie
"j . t . walsh , as the suspicious internal affairs inspector , clocks in with one of his final performances .",movie
"sadly , the talented but underrated actor passed away in late february of this year , and the soon to be released pleasantville will mark his last film .",movie
"walsh appeared in dozens of movies such as good morning vietnam , backdraft , and nixon .",movie
"for one of his best performances , check out sling blade , in which he plays a mental patient sharing a ward with billy bob thornton .",movie
"when jack nicholson accepted his best actor oscar in march , walsh was one of the men to whom he credited his success ( the actors performed together in a few good men ) .",movie
"the negotiator is actually dedicated to walsh , and while inspector niebaum may not have been his best role , it certainly characterizes the type of character for which walsh had become most famous for playing .",movie
"in the end , the negotiator has a plotline that parallels it's reality .",movie
we're served with the premise that two equally deft negotiators are battling each other to resolve the conflict in the manner which will suit each of them best .,movie
"as an audience , we're also given a situation where two wonderfully talented actors are thrown into a movie , and we'd like to see if one will dominate the film .",movie
both provide some pretty good entertainment .,movie
"plot : a young man who loves heavy metal music and especially the band steel dragon , to whom he's devoted a tribute band in which he sings , gets launched into stardom when the real group get rid of their lead singer and call on him to take his place .",movie
critique : i'm a sucker for movies like this .,movie
"a young man with a humble background and lofty dreams , works hard , devotes the time , the energy and the patience , and ultimately hits it big-time .",movie
"in the case of this film , our boy loves a certain heavy metal band and as luck would have it ( yup , luck always finds its way into these types of equations , although generally tied very closely to hard work ) , they need a new singer .",movie
"his entry and adaptation to the whole "" rock 'n roll "" lifestyle fills the rest of the film and is really fun to watch .",movie
although i will preface this by saying that one thing that would definitely enhance your appreciation for this film is your own love ( or past love ) of heavy metal music and the whole scene around it .,movie
"metal was one of my first loves as a teen and even though the genre of music isn't that prominent anymore , i still check out my motley crue , twisted sister and anthrax cds every now and again .",movie
"that's not to say that you won't like this film if you don't like the music , but the music and live performances from the band , play a big part in the movie , and i for one , had a blast watching and listening to it all .",movie
but the even greater draw in this film is the standout performance given here by mark wahlberg .,movie
"wow , hand this fella some major props , as he totally becomes this heavy metal geek/god ( incidentally , metal god was the film's original title , and a much better one if you ask me ) .",movie
he is this movie and i was quite taken by his character pretty much the whole way through .,movie
"he came off like a regular guy with extremely passionate goals and work ethic , who was willing to do anything in order to fulfill his dreams .",movie
"aniston was also surprisingly good as the girlfriend ( and the romance angle between them was sweet ) , but she didn't pull me in hard enough during their emotional scenes .",movie
"i was also impressed by some of the "" real "" musicians who played in the film ( zakk wylde from ozzy osbourne , jeff pilson from dokken , stephan jenkins from third eye blind , blas elias from slaughter ) , but actor dominic west as kirk cuddy made the biggest impression among the band members .",movie
"it's to note that this film was based on a real-life tale of a young man who used to sing in a judas priest cover band and then went on to become their actual singer ( their original singer also admitted to being gay , as in this film ) .",movie
"just for the record , i'm certainly not recommending this film for its originality or surprise elements , since most of this stuff has already been covered in some way or another in other movies , but because it's a fun , uplifting , well-paced movie with a solid central showing by wahlberg and energetic live performances .",movie
"oh yeah , and for those who dig the "" heavier "" side of music , the soundtrack also rocks ! !",movie

can come true . . .,movie

carry on matron is the last great carry-on film in my opinion .,movie
"made in 1972 , it still features most of the regulars of this genre .",movie
"sid james plays the head of a gang of crooks intent on stealing contraceptive pills from the local maternity hospital and selling them off to make a profit , kenneth williams is sir bernard cutting , head of the hospital but also a hypochondriac , hattie jacques re-takes her role as matron , and charles hawtrey is the psychiatrist dr . goode .",movie
"the jokes come in fast and so do the laughs , with humorous antics between the matron and sir bernard .",movie
"this time , williams is after matron ( jacques ) when he needs to prove himself that he is a man after visiting dr . goode .",movie
"the doctor ( hawtrey ) is sworn to secrecy : - "" i assure you , that anything you say to me today will go in one ear and straight out of the other ! """,movie
bernard thinks he is having a sex change and needs to prove himself .,movie
"there are great cameos from joan sims , an expectant mother who is many weeks overdue and is eating constantly in every scene , and from kenneth connor as the expectant father who still thinks he's at work ( at the railway station ) .",movie
sid james' gang including cyril his son ( kenneth cope ) try to find out where the pills are by getting cyril to dress up as a nurse and live in at the nurses home .,movie
he has to share a room with nurse ball ( barbara windsor ) and she soon sees through him !,movie
the film ends with the attempted robbery of the hospital's pills with panic ensuing .,movie
"there are good performances by hattie jacques as the matron , however her character seems a little more subdued and quieter than her previous 'matron's' .",movie
"williams is , as usual , on top form , but sid james isn't given a very good part in this movie and i would forgive anyone to forget that he was in the movie at all .",movie
"the same does not go for charles hawtrey , for although he only first appears in the movie after 30 minutes gone and has scarce screen time , he seems to steal every scene he is in .",movie
"by not making use of sid james and barbara windsor's talent to full effect , the film seems to flounder , but it certainly makes up for it with it's good storyline and it's other appealing characters .",movie
this film is genuinely funny and i could watch it again and again and not get bored !,movie
"the ultimate match up between good and evil , "" the untouchables "" is an excellent movie because it looks deeper into an already examined rivalry .",movie
"based on the 1959 television show of the same title , "" the untouchables "" may be an exaggeration of the real life events that took place , but it fits together perfectly with some beautifully filmed action sequences , some excellent acting , a memorable score , and a clever script .",movie
the film takes place in chicago during the prohibition era where mobsters led by the ruthless al capone run an underground market of liquor to the demanding public .,movie
elliot ness and a small force of men known as the untouchables attempt the impossible by trying to stop capone and trying to maintain peace and order .,movie
"however , as ness soon learns , in order to stabilize peace , you have to bend a few laws .",movie
the fact that capone is evil is very apparent from the first few scenes .,movie
"the film begins with capone , played perfectly by deniro , declaring that he is not a violent man and he is a firm believer in following all laws .",movie
the film then quickly transfers to the next scene in which one of capone's men bombs a restaurant that contains many innocent people including a little girl .,movie
"from this point we know capone is evil , not only because he kills without hesitation , but also because he is a lying bastard .",movie
"right from the first five minutes of the film , de palma has created a hatred towards capone and he shows that this man must be brought down at all costs .",movie
"this developed hatred is before the film's hero , ness , is even introduced .",movie
i found this approach to be very clever because in a small duration of time there is a great amount of admiration for ness and an equal amount of hatred for capone .,movie
the film only gets better from this point .,movie
"with the formation of the untouchables , there is a group of men wearing long , dark overcoats and hats .",movie
they walk in unison and they only look forward .,movie
as they walk down the streets they are observed and feared by citizens .,movie
"holding shot guns and pistols in their hands to stop criminals , this image of vigilantes must have influenced future films .",movie
"one that comes to mind is "" the matrix "" when neo , morpheus , trinity , and the rest of the gang first come into the virtual world .",movie
"wearing more futuristic outfits of the same 1930's style , the similarities between these two are countless .",movie
""" the untouchables "" has some of the hippest , bravest heroes in any action film .",movie
the four members were the only ones willing to go against capone's army .,movie
each member of this special group also had their own characteristics that separated them from others .,movie
"elliot ness , played with perfect ingenuity by kevin costner , is a character that surely grows during the course of the film .",movie
he begins as a man who is determined to follow all laws no matter how unfair they may be .,movie
"however , as the film develops so does ness .",movie
his beliefs involving the law are shattered when he realizes that those he trusted are actually members of the other side .,movie
he also begins to lose his stability when his adversaries begin to murder his friends .,movie
his anger becomes so thunderous that he can no longer hold it in .,movie
"sean connery , who won an academy award for best supporting actor in his role , plays malone , an aging cop who decides to make one final run as a member of the untouchables .",movie
malone acts as a mentor to ness .,movie
"he teaches him "" the chicago way "" to do things ; when they attack with a knife , you attack with a gun .",movie
connery plays his character with the exact amount of wit and experience needed .,movie
"andy garcia does a wonderful job as george stone , a young man who is just becoming a police officer .",movie
"as ness grows , he begins to teach stone some valuable lessons that malone once taught him .",movie
charles martin smith is also fantastic as the final member who attempts to use an income tax offense against capone .,movie
smith is perfect for his role as he adds some valuable comic relief to the film .,movie
the action scenes are also some of the most beautifully choreographed i have ever seen .,movie
"also very similar to "" the matrix , "" they are exciting and intense .",movie
">from a western-like battle to the famous confrontation at the train station steps , the scenes are well thought out and well executed .",movie
the score during these scenes ingeniously adds to the excitement .,movie
its pounding drum beats act as a rhythm for the actors .,movie
the combination of image and music is very impressive and also very effective .,movie
"although the real life untouchables may have been excessively glorified , this film is pure entertainment and contains a unique blend of great acting , great directing , and great action .",movie
"some scenes ( capone and the baseball bat , the train station ) have stuck in my mind for years and seeing them again will only make them more vivid .",movie
"having not seen , "" who framed roger rabbit "" in over 10 years , and not remembering much besides that i liked it then , i decided to rent it recently .",movie
watching it i was struck by just how brilliant a film it is .,movie
"aside from the fact that it's a milestone in animation in movies ( it's the first film to combine real actors and cartoon characters , have them interact , and make it convincingly real ) and a great entertainment it's also quite an effective comedy/mystery .",movie
"while the plot may be somewhat familiar the characters are original , especially baby herman , and watching them together is a lot of fun .",movie
the story begins in hollywood in 1947 .,movie
"cartoon star roger rabbit is blowing takes and having trouble keeping his mind on work , so hard-boiled private detective eddie valiant ( bob hoskins ) is called in by studio head r . k .",movie
maroon ( alan tilvern ) to try to help get roger's mind back on work .,movie
"maroon thinks that roger's wife , jessica's , possible unfaithfulness to him might be the cause of distraction and tells eddie to get some photos of her in the act before it costs him any more money in reshoots .",movie
"valiant takes some photos of jessica playing , `patty cake' with marvin acme ( stubby kaye ) , the owner of toontown ( where all of the cartoon characters live ) and takes them to maroon .",movie
"upon seeing them , roger is emotionally destroyed and soon after acme is found dead and roger rabbit is the prime suspect .",movie
the rest of the movie follows valiant and roger as they run around town ( and eventually toontown ) trying to clear roger's good name .,movie
along the way they meet judge doom ( christopher lloyd ) a judge-jury-and executioner type who's out to get roger and has discovered the one and only way to kill a `toon . ',movie
`who framed roger rabbit' won 4 academy awards including a special achievement award for richard williams for animation direction and creation of the cartoon characters ( williams and his teams went through the film frame by frame and hand drew the cartoon characters in ) .,movie
"director robert zemekis must be given an equal amount of praise for overseeing the entire production , which included hundreds of animators .",movie
also bob hoskins' performance should be credited .,movie
"he , in addition to the rest of the human cast , finds the right note to play in all of the scenes with his cartoon co-stars .",movie
"according to the internet movie database , hoskins studied his young daughter to learn how to act with imaginary characters and i guess his hard work paid off .",movie
`who framed roger rabbit' is a rare film .,movie
one that not only presented a great challenge to the filmmakers but one that can be enjoyed by the whole family ( although some very young viewers may be a little scared by judge doom ) .,movie
"do yourself a favor and rent it , `p-p-p-p-please . """,movie
there's something about ben stiller that makes him a popular choice among casting directors these days .,movie
"stiller currently has three projects in circulation , and what other actor can lay claim to that ?",movie
"he's in "" there's something about mary , "" which i * still * haven't seen .",movie
"and he's in the acerbic "" your friends & neighbors , "" playing a talkative , sexually-frustrated drama coach called jerri .",movie
"now there's "" permanent midnight , "" in which stiller plays another jerry , this one a heroin-addicted television writer , last name stahl .",movie
there's also something about this industry that pushes bankable stars like stiller into doing drug-addiction pictures the minute they've proved themselves commercially .,movie
"ewan mcgregor springs to mind who , after successful turns in "" emma "" and "" brassed off , "" received greater respect and admiration for his mind-blowing realization as renton in danny boyle's transatlantic junk-fest , "" trainspotting . """,movie
"the philosophy appears to be a simple one : if you want 'em to be taken seriously , make 'em do drugs .",movie
""" permanent midnight "" is based on the true life experiences of jerry stahl , a successful hollywood writer who , in the mid-eighties , had a $5 , 000-a-week job churning out plotlines for disposable tv sitcoms and a $6 , 000-a-week heroin habit .",movie
"a habit , in stahl's own words , "" the size of utah . """,movie
"as stahl , stiller contributes a commanding performance .",movie
"unlike "" trainspotting , "" which was successful in having it both ways by chronicling both the highs and the lows of heroin abuse , "" permanent midnight "" instead focuses on the concept of drug addiction as maintenance .",movie
"one of the earliest observations in the film is a casual reference to "" naked lunch "" author william s . burroughs who , when asked why he shoots up first thing in the morning responds , "" so i can shave . """,movie
"stahl rarely appears to be puncturing veins for the thrill of it all in "" permanent midnight "" ; it's so he can talk to his mother on the phone , show up for work on time , even pay his bills .",movie
"while the film itself occasionally wobbles around along with stahl , the writing ( adapted from stahl's autobiography by director david veloz ) is controlled and pointed .",movie
""" permanent midnight "" shows how stahl moved from new york to l . a . to--again in the author's words-- "" escape the drug scene "" ( yeah , right ) ; why he entered into a convenient marriage with a british tv exec ( elizabeth hurley , so impossibly polite you'd swear her single profanity was dubbed ) ; and that he conceived a child in between his random hirings and firings .",movie
stahl narrates all this in a motel bedroom to a sympathetic lover called kitty ( norristown's own maria bello ) with whom he spent some rehab time .,movie
"janeane garofalo is wasted--and miscast--as a heavily-bespectacled hollywood talent agent who fails to get her hooks into the doped-up wordsmith , and that's stahl himself playing a jaded clinic counselor .",movie
"stiller , unshaven ( burroughs take note ) and with lots of mascara around the eyes , has stahl stumble through the film looking like a train wreck but , to his credit , never once pushes his pill-popping , needle-jabbing performance over the top .",movie
"the ubiquitous stiller is the reason to see "" permanent midnight "" ; a dark , comic , and strangely absorbing study of assisted living .",movie
by phil curtolo mel gibson ( braveheart ) gave a gripping performance as the father of a young kidnapped boy in ron howard's ransom .,movie
"gibson plays tom mullen , a wealthy business tycoon whose past actions are coming back to haunt him as a deranged psychopath , played by gary sinise ( forrest gump ) , and his band of low-life thugs kidnap his only son for $2 million .",movie
"tom and his wife , kate , played by rene russo ( tin cup ) were instructed not to inform the police , but they contacted the fbi .",movie
"minutes later , an elite team of agents led by delroy lindo ( broken arrow ) are in tom's house and wiring every phone .",movie
"the plot sounds average , just like most other kidnap movies that you've already seen , and it was nothing more than that .",movie
that is until about half-way through the movie .,movie
"suddenly , tom goes to the fox 5 news room and makes a live broadcast saying , "" this is your ransom .",movie
but this is as close as you will ever get to it .,movie
"instead , i am offering this money as a reward on your head , dead or alive . """,movie
"at this point , the plot thickened , and the unusually slow start of the film turned into a suspense-filled action film with great stunts .",movie
the last half of the film is very well done .,movie
"another thing that carries this film are the superb performances by gibson and sinise , as they collide in a game of wits over their cellular phones for most of the movie .",movie
"owen gleiberman of entertainment weekly commented on the subject : "" it makes you wonder what kidnappers did before cell phones . """,movie
"before this movie , sinise played mostly "" good guys , "" first in of mice & men , then in forrest gump , and most recently , in apollo 13 .",movie
but he was surprisingly devilish and cold in his portrayal of a cop-gone-bad .,movie
"gibson , of course , was just being gibson , in an oscar-worthy performance .",movie
"although most of the scenes were quite predictable , ransom is a very entertaining and suspenseful film .",movie

one can not observe a star trek movie and expect to see serious science fiction .,movie
"the purpose of star trek is to provide flashy , innocent fun .",movie
sometimes the stories are compelling .,movie
sometimes they're not .,movie
"but , with the exception of the first film in the series ( which provides little more than endless shots of amazed faces ) , i've never been bored by any of the enterprise's numerous missions .",movie
star trek : insurrection is no exception .,movie
"the film has gotten some negative reviews ( a friend of mine actually thinks it's the worst in the series ) , but i'm not really sure why .",movie
"it's an exciting , often hilarious movie that engaged me and left me ready for the next star trek film .",movie
"some say it's a bit too light , and more of a long episode than a film .",movie
others say the special effects are cheesy and that it's boring .,movie
i simply enjoyed the film .,movie
"insurrection , which is the second film to feature strictly the next generation cast , introduces us to a race of people called the ba'ku ; the ba'ku are very old ( most of them are about three hundred years old ) , but they actually appear younger with age due to strange radiation in the rings of their planet .",movie
"of course , these peaceful people can't horde this fountain of youth all for themselves ? leave it up to their archenemies , the son'a , led by ru'afo ( f .",movie
"murray abraham ) , to mess everything up .",movie
"the son'a , who are horribly disfigured and rely on daily reconstructive surgery to be aesthetically acceptable , strike a deal with the federation to move the ba'ku elsewhere and exploit the secret to keep their race from dying .",movie
that's when captain picard ( patrick stewart ) steps in : he realizes that moving the ba'ku would kill them ( it also helps that he falls in love with a ba'ku woman ( donna murphy ) ) .,movie
"so , with his trusty crew , picard defies the federation to keep the ba'ku in their natural habitat .",movie
"when dealing with a series with as much history as this , it's not entirely necessary to re-introduce your characters with each episode .",movie
"this is why i believe non-fans have a hard time getting into star trek ; in order to enjoy it , one has to understand how to approach it .",movie
"insurrection , however , does a surprisingly good job of us new aspects of the characters .",movie
"stewart is bold as always , a magnetic screen presence and perfectly capable of holding an entire film together .",movie
"jonathan frakes , who also directed , is funny as commander riker ; a subplot with data ( brent spiner ) discovering his lost childhood is fairly interesting ; and abraham makes a perfect star trek villain , overacting like crazy .",movie
"frakes showed similar aptitude for direction in first contact ; insurrection is an exciting film , with some really attractive special effects and a lot of good action .",movie
"this is apparently the first star trek film to utilize computer animation , and the result is very pleasing to the eye : particularly in the climactic scenes , in which the son'a employ a giant space ship to suck up the rings of the ba'ku planet , the special effects have a clean , impressively sharp look .",movie
"if i have any complaint about the film , it's that it tries to take a moral stance when it's not very appropriate to do so .",movie
i don't think it's that big of a deal that the federation wanted to move 600 ba'ku in order to save the lives of thousands .,movie
"better yet , why couldn't they have co-existed ?",movie
insurrection feels a little to light to spring these kinds of big moral questions on the audience .,movie
"with it's inherent camp factor , the star trek series doesn't seem well-equipped to deal with issues like this .",movie

">from ace ventura to truman burbank , jim carrey has run the whole gamut of comic , yet sympathetic , characters .",movie
"1996's the cable guy was supposed to be his big "" breakthrough "" role from zany humor into darker , more dramatic acting .",movie
"as most everyone knows , the results were , well , less-than-stellar .",movie
"not only did the film not do so hot at the box office , but it was also panned by critics .",movie
"as far as i know , gene siskel and i are the only ones willing to admit that we dug it .",movie
"the first time i saw the cable guy , in theatres , i was in super critic-mode , and didn't really like it .",movie
"however , due to the fact that hbo shows the movie every single day , i've had time to lean back , relax , and take in the film .",movie
"and to my surprise , it grew on me .",movie
"the plot is rather simple : broderick plays a guy named steven who befriends his cable guy , played by carrey , then is stalked by him when steven tries to break off the relationship .",movie
"see , steven's been having some problems with his girlfriend , robin ( leslie mann ) , and he doesn't think he has any more room in his life for a new friend .",movie
"also , some of the cable guy's antics have been creeping him out .",movie
"carrey , as the cable guy , gives steven various aliases , which later we find out are all tv characters : larry tate , chip douglas , ricky ricardo , etc . he apparently lives in his cable van , and while many critics didn't enjoy this newer , darker , less-manic performance from carrey , i thought it was interesting and rather well-done .",movie
"for me , its not the movie as a whole that's enjoyable , but rather several individual scenes : a karaoke jam at steven's apartment , a medieval fight at a theme restaurant , and a bathroom beating ( a la liar , liar ) , just to name a few .",movie
perhaps the fact that more of carrey's humorous side comes out during these scenes is what makes them so funny .,movie
"and if you really want to see something , you've got to hear his version of jefferson airplane's "" somebody to love "" , sung at the aformentioned karaoke jam .",movie
"the cable guy has its bad spots , like most any movie .",movie
"i didn't particularly like steven's girlfriend , and i felt that more focus should have been used on the relationship between steven and his best friend .",movie
"also , the ending , while having you fooled for a moment , is rather contrived , and somewhat dissapointing .",movie
"still , i found the cable guy to be a worthwhile venture ; if you're at the video store and can't think of anything to rent , i suggest you try it out .",movie

""" well , "" he shouts , laughing , "" isn't that obvious ? """,movie
the story is propelled by a device in which bulworth puts out a contract on his own life ( he muses later that it's a bad thing to make decisions when you're suicidal ) ; he keeps seeing a man in sunglasses ( graham beckel ) whom he believes to be the hitman .,movie
? bulworth also meets nina ( halle berry ) with whom he becomes infatuated .,movie
"? suddenly , in the short span of this weekend , bulworth's no-nonsense "" truth in politics "" methods become a national sensation , and he shoots ahead in the polls despite the fact that he's appearing on television wearing gang clothes and spewing more profanity than coherent sentences .",movie
beatty's work on both sides of the camera is excellent . ?,movie
"his script and direction are both extremely sharp , as is the surprisingly strong characterization of bulworth himself . ?",movie
"here is a man who's reached his limit , and his way of lashing back is by screwing over the entire political structure . ?",movie
"i like that the film doesn't take a clear shot at any of the political parties or affiliations , but at politics in general and how everything is run by the rich ( although the anti-rich sentiments do get a bit tiresome by the end of the film ) . ?",movie
"some of the segments are simply hilarious , such as a lengthy rap that he delivers at a luncheon dedicated to him . ?",movie
"much of the film is completely absurd , but that's the fun part about it . ?",movie
"it's an angry , serious film at the core , but the package that beatty has created is so much more accessible than recent attempts in the genre . ?",movie
what adds to this feeling is beatty's portrayal of bulworth ; this is a performance that deserves recognition on a higher scale .,movie
"? beatty is so much fun to watch here -- he's always funny , but he's also subtle in ways that flesh out his character without dialogue or hugely noticeable actions .",movie
"? beatty is so good that bulworth , despite his shortcomings as a human being , is an entirely sympathetic and likable character almost from the beginning .",movie
the supporting cast is vast and colorful . ?,movie
"berry is luminous , as always , and adds to her repertoire of solid supporting roles . ?",movie
don cheadle has a good role as a drug dealer who uses gun-toting toddlers to do his dirty work . ?,movie

i suppose some may see it that way . ?,movie
"i wasn't offended by the film , but then again , i hardly care about politics . ?",movie
i think that people who find this film offensive will just be blindsided by the honesty of the story . ?,movie
"the film isn't perfect , of course -- the ending didn't quite work for me , and the a few of the scenes between bulworth and nina feel forced ( although the eclectic dance sequence is fantastic ) . ?",movie
but these are minor quibbles about an otherwise brilliant film . ?,movie

"call 911 for the cliche police if you must , but the eyes are the window to the soul .",movie

"we will never have a chance to discover if tupac shakur could have been a great actor , but he had that unique quality in his eyes .",movie
"in gridlock'd , an oddly effective combination of gritty drama and social satire , shakur and his co-star tim roth take sketchy characters and make them exciting to watch through the pure energy of their talent and chemistry .",movie
"shakur and roth play ezekiel "" spoon "" whitmore and alexander "" stretch "" rome , two detroit buddies who share a spoken word/jazz trio , an apartment and a drug addiction with cookie ( thandie newton ) .",movie
"when a new year's eve party ends with cookie comatose after a drug overdose , spoon and stretch begin to wonder if they are living on borrowed time .",movie
"they soon make a new year's resolution to get into rehab , but that proves to be easier said than done .",movie
"as though the temptation to fix were not hindrance enough , spoon and stretch also find their attempts to get clean hitting a road block of bureaucracy , confusion and red tape .",movie
"the government might be the least of their obstacles , however , as they find themselves suspects in the murder of a drug dealer , and on the run from a nasty thug ( vondie curtis hall ) .",movie
"in order for you to buy into gridlock'd at all , you have to accept it as a surreal odyssey rather than as urban realism ; unless spoon and stretch sleep through an entire day at the hospital after bringing in cookie , they are going to government offices on new year's day , in which case they should be thankful they get any help at all .",movie
"gridlock'd may actually be a response to the fatuous social commentary of another urban odyssey , 1991's falling down , which found a besieged middle class white male venting his righteous anger against the system during a trek through inner city los angeles .",movie
"in falling down , michael douglas' d-fens ( the character's personalized license plate , echoed in gridlock'd by the drug lord d-reper's plates ) whips out a gun because he can't get breakfast at mcdonald's ; in gridlock'd , spoon and stretch are unarmed against the demands placed on them before they can get into a rehab center .",movie
"and where the unhinged d-fens became a heroic surrogate for audiences , writer/director vondie curtis hall refuses to let spoon and stretch off the hook for their own part in the situation .",movie

"because you picked _today_ to clean up ? """,movie
"the world in gridlock'd is just as frustrating as the world in falling down , but the cathartic moments yield no easy answers this time .",movie
"hall has some interesting things to say about what we expect from the system , but perhaps not enough of them .",movie
"a significant chunk of gridlock'd is devoted to spoon and stretch's flight from d-reper and from the police , and those sub-plots serve up some thoroughly predictable moments .",movie
"in one scene , stretch scares off d-reper by getting chummy with a police officer ; another presents that old chestnut of the two mistakenly-suspected heroes in a public place watching a television news report of the crime which shows their pictures .",movie
"the entire sequence of events seems designed merely as an excuse to get spoon and stretch running , while the other primary plot has them standing in line or sitting down much of the time .",movie
"hall also plays with gratuitous inserts of drug paraphernalia and flashbacks to the day before the film's main events , perhaps making a particular effort to point out the talent the characters are wasting through self-destructive behavior .",movie
"oh , the irony of it .",movie
"tupac shakur made a career in music and movies playing the hard case , and living the life to back it up .",movie
"in gridlock'd , shakur gets the chance to play someone who has seen enough of the way his life could go to know that it scares him .",movie
"spoon is an idea for a character at best as written by hall , but shakur displays an intelligence and survival instinct which struggle with his addiction .",movie
"mostly it comes through those eyes , eyes with none of the hardness you might expect from the infamous gangsta .",movie
"it is spoon who plays conscience to stretch's pure appetite , and roth plays stretch with a gleeful self-destructiveness ( he reveals that he is hiv positive even as he is preparing to shoot up again ) which is as much an obstacle to spoon's goal as any agency or enemy .",movie
"gridlock'd's most cruelly comic scene finds stretch "" helping "" spoon get into an emergency room by repeatedly stabbing him with a tiny pocket knife , and it becomes an appropriate symbol for how the company he keeps has slowly drained the life out of him .",movie
"with friends like that , spoon doesn't need enemies , and shakur looks at stretch with the tired eyes of a man who has seen too much .",movie
the tragedy now is that we won't get more chances to see those eyes again .,movie

director roland emmerich ( universal solider ) shamelessly rips off lucas and spielberg and just about any other cosmic cliche that he can lay his hands on .,movie
"the film is overlong , the characters are cardboard , and the script is filled with some of the most laughable details in modern sci-fi history .",movie

"sci-fi fans should enjoy the sculpted sands , the morphing headdresses , and a surprisingly spunky james spader .",movie

star trek generations =====================,movie
"trek fans may be more forgiving , but , for the rest of us , the sluggish star trek generations is a mixed bag at best .",movie
"the story is interesting , but each scene goes too long .",movie
"the cast is earnest , but the direction lacks punch .",movie
and so on .,movie
( the best example of the latter is a klingon comeuppance that delivers none of the impact of a similar scene in star trek ii . ),movie
"original enterprise captain james t . kirk appears on both ends of the story , though they cut the scene where shatner turns to the screen to plead "" get a life . """,movie
remarkably unremarkable .,movie

"in a season of the specialist and pulp fiction et al , maybe a remake of miracle on 34th street * is * necessary .",movie
john hughes certainly believes in santa claus and his les mayfield-directed production does nothing to tarnish the memory of the 1947 original .,movie
"the romance between costars dylan mcdermott and elizabeth perkins doesn't work too well , but the film makes a strong case that richard attenborough is the definitive kriss kringle .",movie

how's * that * for a collision of acting styles ?,movie
"for those of us who weren't yet born when the 1960's rock 'n' rolled around , monterey pop affords an affectionate glimpse of the music that influenced our parents to be hippies .",movie
"from otis redding to jimi hendrix , janis joplin to the mamas and the papas , and jefferson airplane to the who , this documentary is jam-packed with contagious energy .",movie
"but i give fair warning that i will reveal the ending , which does not do the rest of the film the justice it deserves .",movie
"shot in 1969 at an outdoor concert that precluded woodstock , the film defies the stereotype of the general population at the time .",movie
"sure , some have painted their faces and smoke joints , but d . a .",movie
"pennebaker ( the war room , moon over broadway ) surprisingly chooses to show a broad spectrum of the audience .",movie
"no matter who is watching , it all comes back to the talented musicians that stir your soul .",movie
the excitement starts before the music even begins .,movie
"a young girl is cleaning thousands of seats and when asked why by an interviewer , she replies that she feels lucky to do so .",movie
"there are moments of organized craziness as john phillips , leader of the mamas and the papas and one of the concert organizers , tries to get in touch with dionne warwick .",movie
"and when one band is tuning up , a member remarks , "" finally , a decent sound system ! """,movie
"you can tell just by watching these first few moments that this show isn't about vanity , it's about playing the music you love to those who have an appreciation for it , a two-way street .",movie
this interaction between audience and performer continues throughout the film and becomes infectious to the audience .,movie
it's impossible to tear your eyes away from janis joplin as she belts out her ballad about love being a ball and chain .,movie
"and while the lyrics to "" wild thing "" may not be all that complicated , watching jimi hendrix mime having sex with his guitar is as captivating as otis redding singing about love .",movie
"even if you don't recognize every band you see on stage , you can imagine being as enthralled by their work as the public sitting in those seats .",movie
"the only drawback to the film is the ending , which unfortunately i must reveal .",movie
"all the other bands , big names then and still today , got approximately 7 to 10 minutes of screen time .",movie
"in contrast , the last band on camera , a wholly forgettable one , gets an entire 18 minutes of screen time .",movie
"for a film that's only 78 minutes long , that's too large of a chunk , especially when previous acts are much more stimulating .",movie
"all in all , monterey pop is a precious , rare look at a time period that still holds sway over us .",movie
"the variety of music , as well as the beautifully shot performances , are easy to become immersed in .",movie
"if there was ever any question as to why most of these bands were so popular , this is quickly dispelled .",movie
it's almost depressing to think that music this moving doesn't get made much anymore .,movie
"instead we're stuck with * nsync , the backstreet boys , and jennifer lopez , all of whom should have stuck with modeling .",movie
"the most common ( and in many cases the only ) complaint against francis ford coppola's 1972 masterpiece the godfather is glamorising of mafia , which is presented as an institution guided by ancient tradition and virtues like honour , loyalty and solidarity more suitable for some gentler , kinder ages .",movie
"martin scorsese , another italoamerican moviemaker , confronted that perspective with his own , more down-to-earth vision of mafia in 1973 mean streets , movie that dealt with lower echelons of organised crime .",movie
"unfortunately for scorsese , his film was unspectacular and too artsy to compete with coppola's influence on mafia portrayals in the movies .",movie
seventeen years later scorsese returned to mean streets of new york with another film that dealt with darker side of american organised crime .,movie
"this film was goodfellas , epic black comedy which is today considered as one of the best and most influential films of 1990s .",movie
"goodfellas owes some of its initial success and popularity to the fact that it was based on the true story , told in best-seller book wiseguy by nicholas pileggi ( who would co-write the screenplay for the film ) .",movie
"the book , as well as the film , chronicled thirty years in the life of henry hill ( played by ray liotta ) , irish-italian criminal from new york .",movie
"at the age of 13 he gets recruited in the criminal organisation of paulie cicero ( played by paul sorvino ) , local mob boss , and gradually climbs up the ladder starting with small errands .",movie
"after couple of years , together with his best childhood friend tommy de vito ( played by joe pesci ) , he joins the crew of expert thieves led by jimmy conway ( played by robert de niro ) .",movie
"three of them spend years as best friends and associates , gathering enormous wealth from their criminal enterprises that would culminate with one of the most spectacular robberies in american history .",movie
"wealth , influence and privileges of men connected with mafia are enough for henry hill to seduce his future wife karen ( played by lorraine bracco ) , who would afterwards remain loyal to her husband despite infidelities , domestic abuse , arrests and would even be accomplice to his own private drug dealing business .",movie
"but the perfect world of "" wiseguys "" gradually begins to fall apart - tommy's unpredictable outbursts of homicidal violence , jimmy's reluctance to share his part of the loot with partners and , finally , henry's own drug habit would lead to his downfall and make him question his loyalty to the friends .",movie
goodfellas is an excellent example of a film that represents work of a film genius in his full glory .,movie
scorsese managed to create a vision which is effective and complete despite being full of contradictions that would ripped the film apart in the hands of less talented filmmaker .,movie
world depicted in this film is both ordinary and fascinating .,movie
"scorsese spares no effort to show us all the violence , hypocrisy and inherent paranoia of organised crime , yet it manages to make it both seductive and funny .",movie
"after being exposed to two and half hours of the film and three decades of criminal history ( based on some notorious real life events ) , the audience understands why the characters chose such dangerous life paths , trading the superficial and short-lasting glamour and prosperity of a criminal to the dullness and poverty of honest citizens .",movie
"scorsese also manages to break viewer's moralistic inhibitions by showing truly revolting material - scenes that depict personal tragedies , broken homes , human depravity , violence , bloodshed and murder - in all their uncompromising reality , but in a manner that would make it amusing and funny to the audience .",movie
"with the use of ironic soundtrack , manipulative shots , character's dialogue or narrator's commentary , goodfellas represents the new standards of black humour that would became very popular few years later during tarantino era .",movie
"even if we don't pay attention to skills with which potentially disturbing material becomes eye pleasing and entertaining , we should admit that scorsese displays his talents of truly original and creative filmmaker .",movie
"first , we might notice unusual structure of the plot - relatively minor subplot is used as movie's ironic prologue .",movie
"then , instead of single narrator , scorsese switches to the second character as narrator in the middle of the film only to switch back to the original shortly afterwards .",movie
"this multiple points of views , both in terms of narration and various subjective shots , only lengthens the ironic distance towards characters and their situation .",movie
same ironic distance comes with extremely effective choice of soundtrack .,movie
"nostalgia for good old times is illustrated with easy-listening 1950s pop songs , while depression , paranoia and bad times find their expression in more neurotic rock songs of late 1960s and 1970s .",movie
"but the soundtrack is most effective when it is used as ironic comment - almost pastoral , easy listening tunes make strong and very ironic contrast to the scenes of violence and bloodshed .",movie
"however , thing most associated with this film is couple of continuos shots that feature characters moving through large rooms and interacting with dozens if not hundreds of people .",movie
"such scenes , although they require very great skill and patience during their shootings , became very popular among other directors in 1990s .",movie
"fragmentary character of the screenplay , which doesn't have straight plot and instead bases film on series of loosely connected vignettes , gives another interesting opportunity for scorsese .",movie
"he uses this structure of film to experiment , and most successful of such experiments is hilarious "" a day in life "" segment near the end of the film .",movie
another essential element of goodfellas is large but superb collection of great acting talents .,movie
"the most respectable among them is robert de niro , but his character , who happen to be most quiet and business-like member of criminal trio , gets overshadowed by two of his friends and colleagues .",movie
"joe pesci deserved his "" oscar "" for supporting role of homicidal psychopath tommy , and his lines , including ad-libs , probably represent the most memorable element of the film .",movie
"ray liotta , although equally talented , perhaps doesn't look as the best choice for narrator and nominal hero of the film .",movie
liotta's henry hill looks somewhat too hollywoodised and glamorous among this bunch of low-level street thugs .,movie
"liotta , on the other hand , improves general impression by very realistic and menacing portrayal of drug addiction .",movie
"lorraine bracco is , on the other hand , very effective and believable as karen hill , wife who gradually descends into same moral cesspool as her husband .",movie
"paul sorvino is also very effective as patriarch mafioso , and among the supporting cast most memorable is chuck low as pestering small-time gangster who unknowingly digs his own grave .",movie
"as a combination of clever sociological study , black humour and innovative filmmaking goodfellas became something only the truly great films could do - work of art and excellent popular entertainment in the same time .",movie
"because of this achievement , and also because of the great influence on future filmmakers , this cinematic gem deserves its rightful place among the best films of 1990s .",movie
""" the blair witch project "" was perhaps one of a kind , a unique film that played completely on its own merit , managing to scare even the most experienced horror fans out of their senses .",movie
"its success made a sequel inevitable , but this is not the sequel , i suspect , anyone much wanted .",movie
"after the release of "" the blair witch project "" , tourists have practically invaded the small town of burkettsville , in order to get a glimpse of the blair witch .",movie
"locals have turned this mass hysteria into a great business opportunity , selling twig-sculptures , stones and dirt like those in the movie , and the exasperated local sheriff patrols the woods with a bullhorn , shouting , "" get out of these woods and go home !",movie
"there is no goddamned blair witch ! "" .",movie
"jeff ( ) is one of those people , who has used the sudden popularity of the small town to his advantage .",movie
"after he got released from the mental institution , he created a mobile business that attracts thousands of customers through the internet .",movie
"as the movie starts he is leading one of these groups into the woods , on the "" blair witch hunt "" .",movie
"among the five strangers is stephen and his girlfriend , the pregnant tristen , who are writing a book on the hysteria caused by the film called "" the blair witch : history or hysteria ? "" , and kim , who dresses in black and has some psychic powers .",movie
"the last member of the crew is erica , a young beautiful witch-wannabe , who constantly quotes from the wiccan lore , saying "" the first rule of wicca is , do no harm , because whatever you do will come back to you threefold . """,movie

"documentary director joe berlinger ( "" paradice lost "" ) helms "" blair witch 2 "" , leaving the creators of the first film ( dan myrick and ed sanches ) in the background .",movie
"the opening scenes--the documentary showing the townspeople affected by the first film-- is a more promising approach , because instead of trying to cover similar ground , it goes outside the first film and makes its own stand .",movie
"but soon the movie gets confused and sidetracked by its own story , that is never resolved and ends with a very anticlimaxic epilogue .",movie
"in a way , this is a typical hollywood sequel .",movie
more money has been spent and more people have worked on a project that was doomed to fail .,movie
the horror and suspense of the original simply could not be repeated .,movie
"of course in these situations , quantity is more important than quality and profit is more important than the artistical values .",movie
"from its opening scenes when the camera gracefully panes over the bloody-red forest , with carter burwell's ( "" being john malkovich "" and "" fargo "" ) musical score in the background , you realize that with the exception of its title , this film has absolutely nothing to do with "" the blair witch project "" .",movie
""" blair witch . . """,movie

"in the sequel the technical aspect of the film is close to perfection , creating a completely different atmosphere .",movie
"with its graceful cinematography , production design and flashy editing , the film has a very polished look , which is impossible to associate with the first installment .",movie
"and though berlinger directs his film with an energy and pace that makes the adrenaline rush through the body a couple of times , he has obviously misunderstood the nature of his predecessor .",movie
the key is simplicity .,movie
""" blair witch project "" had a story which was incredibly simple .",movie
that allowed the audience to fill the gaps with our own imagination .,movie
"the film was practically an empty screen , on which we projected our most frightening nightmares .",movie
"the effect was incredibly powerful , lasting and entir e everyone , but in a different way .",movie
""" book of shadows "" feels incredibly controlled and restrict .",movie
"here , very little is left to our imagination and the story is so complex and "" clever "" that the screenwriters are the first to get lost in it .",movie
there is is no book of shadows and no conclusion that we can be satisfied with .,movie
this is simply a less artistic film that doesn't have the talent and originality of its predecessor .,movie
it resorts to fancy cinematography and special effects to create the right effect and doesn't always succeed .,movie
"but most importantly : it stands on its own ground and has almost no connection with the first movie , which doesn't allow it to destroy the original .",movie
"in the end , i can't call it a bad effort .",movie
"it's less artistic , not so scary and less original , but certainly not bad .",movie
it's simply different .,movie
"in fact , if you haven't seen "" the blair witch project "" , you might like this film for what it is -- a cross between "" the blair witch project "" and the "" scream "" -films .",movie
the only element that remains constant and similar between the two films is the solid acting ( jeffrey donovan and tristine skyler should be mentioned ) and incredible sense of surrealism .,movie
"but it's a common knowledge and experience that , with a few exceptions , every movie sequel is worse than the original and some are even not worth making .",movie
"to me the story of "" the blair witch project "" seemed completed , but there are obviously no limits to commercial success that "" the book of shadows "" is certainly assured .",movie

"one of the best things about the movies is that they can make you really start to wonder and analyze things in your own , everyday life that you might not have thought much of otherwise .",movie
"with some films it might be just a secondary issue , but with `dark city' what we get is nearly an entire film committed to philosophizing and theorizing about human memory and how it defines who we are , which is a poignant theme made through an absolutely beautifully-constructed film with the kind of story and setting that could only happen in a movie .",movie
"there's an old role-playing computer game called `d ? ja v ? ' wherein the player takes on the role of a man who can't remember who he is , where he is and how he got there .",movie
the goal is to gather as many clues as possible to figure that out and along the way overcome a conflict .,movie
"the premise to this film is not unlike that game , only this time we don't have control over the protagonist .",movie
"we begin by meeting a seemingly ordinary man living in an extremely dark and dirty city ( actually , it's more than just the city , it's the whole reality ) that isn't just that neo-gothic look ( a la `batman , ' `blade runner , ' ) , but is so fully developed it's almost a different genre completely .",movie
"later he will learn that his name is john murdoch ( sewell ) , but for now he has no idea what's going on other than the fact something is not right .",movie
"the fact there's a dead body in the corner goes to enhance the feeling of paranoia and a mysterious , hurried call telling him to leave immediately is also very chilling .",movie
"this opening scene alone goes a long way to define the setting of the film and its bizarre , horrific tone .",movie
the man doesn't know who he is nor where he's going and it's interesting to follow him since we the viewers have no idea either we can sympathize and identify with him .,movie
"in fact , this is the way all stories begin since it's impossible to know the history of a character , their feelings , values , morals , etc . until after we've observed them for a while .",movie
"but in this case , the total feeling of amnesia is an excellent tool towards characterization , developing the mood and outlining the story .",movie
"eventually , some semblance of a plot begins to unfold as it appears that john is a serial killer wanted by the police .",movie
"we met inspector frank bumstead ( hurt ) , a quiet , unemotional , soft-spoken deadpan man who appears to have been on the trail of the killer for some time .",movie
"two other important characters are also introduced : dr . daniel p . schreber ( sutherland ) , a neurotic psychiatrist who claims to be john's doctor ; and emma murdoch ( connelly ) , a jazz singer dolled up to look like a caraciture right out of the old dick tracy serials or any given leading lady of the old film-noir movies .",movie
it was schreber who contacted john for reasons that are continually revealed throughout the course of the film .,movie
"he also contacts emma , which further helps the film reveal what is seemingly a complex , mysterious back story .",movie
"but absolutely nothing is as it appears to be in `dark city , ' which is what makes it so fascinating throughout its continual scenes of confusion and vertigo .",movie
"everything the filmmakers want us to see has some significance - considering how intricate the detail is to every single shot , its lighting , art direction and overall production design , they don't seem to be able to afford any gratuities .",movie
"however , that might also be what's keeping it from reaching its maximum potential .",movie
"by continuing to follow john as he wanders around this strange place , so much unlike the real world we know , we come to realize that it's all a hoax .",movie
everyone in the city is the subject of an experiment being conducted by a race of aliens to understand what makes humans tick in their efforts to somehow save themselves from extinction .,movie

"for reasons that are never clearly explained , it appears that john possesses telekinetic powers to can do pretty much whatever his mind can conceive ( a process known as `tuning' ) .",movie
"the aliens , which look like very old bald human men with pasty skin , also possess the power en masse and use it to change the city every night at midnight .",movie
"at the same time all the humans fall asleep and after the changes are made , they awake and either continue where they left off or begin a new life they have no idea they did not have until then .",movie
this premise certainly is interesting and director and co-screenwriter alex proyas is able to keep the film consistently mysterious in this regard .,movie
he does provide some explanations such as that dr . schreber is an assistant to `the strangers' because he somehow could synthesize memory into chemical form .,movie
the aliens mix and match the memories of the city's population to see who will change and who will not .,movie
"in the process this creates for a good deal of deep , thought-provoking philosophies that could be applied to the real world .",movie
"however , where the film errs is by not playing up the idea of memory versus the human heart as to what makes a person who he or she is .",movie
"the main characters are all closely intertwined within the seemingly complex murder mystery which never actually happened , yet when they start to go through some of the expected emotions it comes off as distant , static and cold ( mediocre performances by hurt and connelly don't help either ) .",movie
"for example , john realizes emma is not and probably never was his wife so he does not feel an emotional bond to her , yet in some scenes crucial to the film's plot , we are expected to believe they do have a genuine love for each other , which is also part of the film's climax and ending .",movie
"and that's what proyas seems to be inferring with the film , but never quite manages to convey in its fullest sense .",movie
"ironically , this is what made his first film `the crow' work so well , which had a similar theme of struggling to find hope and the human spirit within a nearly identical , dark twisted world .",movie
with `dark city' the messenger seems to be mistaken for the message .,movie
"still , the film is by no means bad and is consistently entertaining and enjoyable .",movie
"there's a lot to like here , most notably the sheer visual look and style of it all which accounts for at least half the reasons the film is able to tell the story it does .",movie
the story as a whole is one of the most original to come out of hollywood in years .,movie
`dark city' is what the movies are all about - the escape from the real world .,movie
"linda fiorentino disappeared off the radar after a deservedly heralded turn in the cable pic the last seduction , and her being cast as dogma's lead is nothing short of inexplicable .",movie
"she's still in fine form as bethany , an abortion clinic worker who's lost her faith .",movie
"one night , a visitor from heaven makes a fiery entrance in bethany's bedroom .",movie
"he is metatron ( alan rickman ) , the voice of god , and he needs her help : she must stop two fallen angels from entering a new jersey church-the fate of the universe depends on it .",movie
"god would do it him/herself , but he/she is . . . missing , having taken up human form somewhere on earth never to be heard from again .",movie
"bethany is joined on her road trip to the garden state by the "" prophets "" jay ( jason mewes ) and silent bob ( kevin smith , doing double-duty ) , the slacker minstrels who have appeared in all of smith's films thus far .",movie
"at some point , rock drops naked out of the sky as rufus , the undocumented ( and very black ) "" thirteenth apostle "" , and offers his assistance , as does divine stripper serendipity ( salma hayek ) .",movie
it's a wild ride .,movie
"they're in pursuit of loki and bartleby ( damon and affleck , respectively-this is probably the sharpest either has ever been ) , who were banished from heaven to wisconsin and have discovered a dogmatic loophole that will enable their return .",movie
loki decides to wreak havoc along the way with the knowledge that his sins will be absolved at the pearly gates .,movie
"at one point , he terrorizes a boardroom full of suits with an angry combination of words and bullets .",movie
"it's a nasty , guiltily enjoyable little scene that asks , "" how corrupt are you ? "" .",movie
wings of desire this ain't .,movie
"since debuting with clerks , smith has grown as a director , particularly in terms of working with actors .",movie
"( chris rock is this film's only weak link-between jokes , he's wooden . )",movie
"his no-frills visual style hasn't changed much over the years , though ( dogma's widescreen compositions at least have blockbuster affectations ) , nor has his writing-his characters still sit around delivering one caustic , hilarious speech after another .",movie
"dogma chips away at big religious issues-namely , the hypocrisy that accompanies any organized system of beliefs-eloquently and articulately , but a few of the monologues sound too much like blatant exposition .",movie
"as well , the verbal introduction of each new person seems to take forever .",movie
"any movie with this much weighty talk would have a hard time maintaining momentum ( hurlyburly , anyone ? ) , and eventually dogma's pacing goes slack .",movie
"a long diatribe from bartleby late in the game , in which he laments the destiny of celestial beings , comes at a point when we've heard enough .",movie
"because his change of heart ( bartleby is initially the good cop to loki's bad ) drives the climax , said rant is given a great deal of screen time .",movie
"sure , affleck deserved a big moment ( damon steals their scenes together prior ) , but it ultimately makes the film and us feel bloated .",movie
"like tarantino , smith was a video-age sponge who became a sample-mad indie filmmaker .",movie
"dogma pays welcome homage to an eclectic batch of movies , including indiana jones and the last crusade , with silent bob doing his best harrison ford , and weird science-a shit demon attacks our heroes !",movie
"smith also has a kitchen sink brand of humour : his dexterous maneuvering between the satirical ( a cardinal played by george carlin attempts to mount a publicity campaign with the slogan "" catholicism wow ! "" ) and the scatalogical ensures that no lover of comedy will leave dogma feeling malnourished .",movie
i bust ( ed ? ) a gut on several occasions .,movie
proceedings also get off on the right foot with the opening with the funniest disclaimer ever .,movie
"it's a disclaimer unlikely to put protestors at ease , for to read it , one actually has to see dogma .",movie
"the prerelease ballyhoo is in the tradition of the last temptation of christ's , martin scorsese's 1988 adaptation of nikos kazantzakis' controversial novel , in that it is not directly linked to the picture's content but to rumours and heresy .",movie
"there's a famous anecdote about fletch director michael ritchie inviting picketers of the last temptation of christ into a screening on his dime , just so they could know for certain what they were rallying against .",movie
( not one of them had watched it . ),movie
every single person refused .,movie
"smith and scorsese have a lot in common , and so do the two films in question , because both smith's bethany and scorsese's jesus are hollow shells without their faith .",movie
"in fact , dogma's denouement ( which follows a thrilling showdown that's worth the wait ) is a catholic love-in , a veritable recruitment poster .",movie
( i felt sentimental about a religion i don't belong to .,movie
"now that's powerful filmmaking . ) smith is nothing if not sincere about his own devotion to god , and that spirituality shines through .",movie
it's enough to make me forgive dogma for its editorial sins .,movie
my religion is movies .,movie
"when the catholic league beats on dogma for imaginary crimes against a doctrine , in a roundabout way they're attacking what i live for : freedom of expression through celluloid .",movie
"i therefore feel that , although i'm no bible-thumper , i'm at least as qualified to criticize dogma as william donohue and his followers .",movie
you've heard all the hype .,movie
"you've seen all their faces - natalie portman ( the professional ) as queen amidala , liam neeson ( schindler's list ) as qui-gon jinn , ewan mcgregor ( trainspotting ) as obi-wan kenobi , and jake lloyd ( jingle all the way ) as young anakin skywalker .",movie
"if you've read any reviews , you've also probably heard that this movie fails to live up to the magic and humanity of the first trilogy .",movie
"you also may have heard that this one's too kiddie-friendly , and doesn't have enough content for adults .",movie
believe the hype .,movie
"the effects are stunning , the digitalized creatures are amazingly realistic , the lightsaber duels are amazing , and queen amidala's sumptuous robes are fit to be worn by queen elizabeth .",movie
"but there's something missing here , and it isn't budget or effects - it's everything money * can't * buy .",movie
the actors struggle as best they can to flesh out broad-stroked and flat characters .,movie
"the most successful at this is liam neeson who , as qui-gon jinn , a jedi master to young obi-wan kenobi , has quiet dignity and a wise , commanding presence .",movie
"he is the anchor to this movie , as he is the one character who george lucas apparently spent some time fleshing out .",movie
portman's queen amidala and mcgregor's obi-wan kenobi don't fare nearly so well .,movie
"amidala , the future mother of luke and leia and the queen of a peaceful planet being invaded by the trade federation ( ? ! ? ) , comes off as stoic , stilted and caricatured ( it appears as though she was a vulcan geisha in a former life ) .",movie
"and obi-wan , although mcgregor makes him very endearing , has so little screen time that he's nothing but a robin to qui-gon jinn's batman .",movie
"however , mcgregor does struggle manfully to infuse this surprisingly small supporting role with a spark of genuine insight and humanity , and he does a good job .",movie
"he also absolutely nails alec guiness' ( obi-wan in episode 4 - 6 ) scottish accent , and that really makes his presence in the film more profound than it might have been otherwise .",movie
"in fact , lucas seems to bank on that preexisting knowledge quite a bit , and that's one of the problems with this film .",movie
"i would never call myself a "" star wars "" fan - especially not considering what it means to be a fanatic these days - but i've always enjoyed the films along with everyone else in america .",movie
"however , if you are the one person in america who * hasn't * seen the films at all or even recently , or who doesn't bother to brush-up on the names of obscure characters , you may be hopelessly lost .",movie
"for example , one of the film's main ( nefarious ) characters is senator palpatine .",movie
"for those of you not recently steeped in "" star wars "" trivia , emperor palpatine is that scary hooded apparition who was darth vader's master in "" return of the jedi "" and "" empire strikes back . """,movie
"so , obviously , his appearance in "" phantom menace "" is meant to stir some echoes of his later role in the series , thus making his role here more meaningful .",movie
a lot of the movie is like that .,movie
"r2-d2 and c-3po make token appearances , and it's obvious that lucas is banking on the audience's pre-existing fondness for them . . .",movie
because he doesn't do much to add to it in any way .,movie
"same goes for jabba the hutt , who doesn't look as much mean here as he does corpulent and lazy .",movie
"even * planets * make foreshadowing guest appearances in this film - tatooine ( the desert world where luke grew up ) , coruscant ( the cloud city from "" empire strikes back "" ) , and alderaan ( leia's home planet - which we never actually see - that gets blown up in "" star wars "" ) show up or are mentioned briefly in passing .",movie
what's the result of tying so many plot points and characters to future films ?,movie
the answer is that this one seems surprisingly empty .,movie
"there's no meat - no substance - that makes you want to love the characters as they are , not as they will be .",movie
another problem is that there are actually * too many * alien characters in the film .,movie
"i was distracted by the fact that two of the main evil characters - strange looking aliens who looked like gila monsters - had mouths that barely moved , making them look more like muppets than actual characters .",movie
"and jar jar binks , a silly roger rabbitish amphibious character , is intended as comic relief , but what he really becomes is annoying - and fast .",movie
"unlike chewbacca and c-3po , who got their humanity ( if you'll pardon the expression ) from their interactions with the human characters , jar jar is often left to interact mostly with others of his kind , at times making the movie seem like nothing more than a very expensive "" teenage mutant ninja turtles . """,movie
"furthermore , the dialogue is often stilted and corny , and sometimes downright infantile , thereby rendering some characters into nothing more than bystanders to the plot .",movie
"oddly , this isn't just * my * judgment - lucas has said that he designed this film for kids .",movie
"well , he's done a good job .",movie
"the hero of this film , of course , is young anakin , but it was very hard for me to feel any kinship or identify with an eight-year-old boy .",movie
"that's not jake lloyd's fault , though - he does a good job of being a cute kid , which is apparently all lucas asked of him .",movie
"that's another mistake , of course , because the cute tyke becomes darth vader .",movie
warning : spoilers ahead ! ! ! !,movie
"in my opinion , there was not nearly enough foreshadowing of anakin's future evil in the film .",movie
"the boy is all blond flowing hair and rosy cheeks , and there's nothing more than a spark of aggression in him throughout the entire movie .",movie
"he has a doting mother ( pernilla august , making her first english- language film ) and is a slave to a gross flying gnome on tatooine .",movie
but the only indication the audience gets that this kid isn't all hearts and roses is yoda's hesitation in allowing him to train as a jedi under qui-gon jinn .,movie
his explanation ?,movie
""" his future is clouded . """,movie
( warning : major spoiler ahead .,movie
enter at your own risk . ),movie
"of course , the noble qui-gon dies at the hand of darth maul , a scary-looking sith lord who excels at the jedi arts , but has turned to the dark side .",movie
"this dude has maybe two lines in the entire movie , but he establishes his presence through his amazing moves with his double-sided lightsaber , and his scary facial makeup .",movie
"because qui-gon never gets a chance to train the young anakin in the ways of the force , obi-wan , qui-gon's young padawan apprentice ( one level below knightdom ) , must take over the training himself .",movie
"so , at the end of the movie , we end where the saga actually begins - with obi-wan kenobi and his young apprentice , anakin "" darth vader "" skywalker .",movie
did this story need to be told ?,movie
i would say no .,movie
but is it a worthwhile movie to see ?,movie
absolutely .,movie
"if you don't enter the theater with jedi-size expectations , and you simply want to be treated to an enjoyable visual spectacle , then this is your movie .",movie
the tatooine pod races are a triumph of effects and computer animation .,movie
the digitalized backgrounds on some of the planets are an astonishing sight .,movie
"and yoda and young obi-wan are worth seeing for their origins in a simpler , happier time .",movie
"above all , this is a fun movie .",movie
"not deep , not meaningful , and not profound .",movie
but fun .,movie
"maybe next time , lucas will hire lawrence kasdan to co-write the script , and the guy who directed "" empire "" will direct .",movie

"as african american detective vergil tibbs questions a suspected white murderer inside a jail cell , there is a wonderful , eye-catching shot which instantaneously presents the main message of the entire film .",movie
the shot has tibbs' face completely covered by the shadows of the prison bars .,movie

"as a black detective conducting an investigation in a southern town full of violent white bigots , no matter how innocent tibbs is , he is still seen by these bigots as a threat simply because of the color of his skin .",movie
"the bars show that tibbs has not been given a fair chance to show exactly who he is , instead others have chosen him as different and dangerous .",movie

"I'm only a third way in. Shipped lightening fast.The print quality of the book is very good. I like the rose and the purple foil, they captured her taste here and will look bomb on my bookshelf.As for the writing it's good. Amazing, no. But they painted an incredible picture of her life. Much better writing than I thought to be honest. I was expecting more scattered blurbs throughout the book but the way it's presented does honor her experience, and sounds like her up to an extent. Now, I do think the ghost writer went verbose in some areas that were unnecessary which derailed her voice in my head but I imagine getting the whole picture would be difficult.I was hoping for a thicker book as she's been through a lot. So I am a bit disappointed at that but nevertheless it's an interesting read thus far.As for Britney's life story. I have to say they were smart in starting with her lineage and she didn't hold back keeping her family accountable from the gate. Good on her for having conviction.I suddenly found myself understanding little quirks, connecting the dots, certain things would suddenly click in my head. For example her British accent and her relationship with a lynchpin matriarch elder.Very cool build up. Laying the ground work for her future decisions by presenting us with complex childhood family dynamics really has me understanding her choices and quirks much better than I ever realized I needed to be deep in thought of.Sometimes we judge from a place of pity or outsider perspective instead of compassion. Now I see the soft gentle feminine side of her mindset that we knew when she was younger start to peek through the pages. It's that sweet part of her soul that she doesn't show much nowadays, for good reason of course as she's been deeply hurt and damaged by other's greed, but that delicate nature is part of why most of us were charmed by her. I hope she finds her way back one day.She's been through a lot and I found myself relating to things she'd been through, and feeling deeply saddened by her sense of insecurity in childhood. Her insights correlate along with many of my own life experiences and traumas. I was taken aback by her growth in reflection, as one would believe anger would be the easy way to portray her story, not the case here, it's her appreciation for her past that has earned my deep respect beyond what I thought I had possessed prior to reading.Her story with her brother was touching and softened my distain for his participation in the matter of handling her affairs. Although I hope he is held accountable someday. It shows how loving and innocent she was and how grave a loss she has suffered, for it is those who are selfless that don't speak up only to suffer the most.Such a contrast to the presentation of her character in the media. Thus far this book is an excellent read!------ To be Continued* I'm looking forward to reading through this book in it's entirety and will update when I'm done. One star for the writing not sounding like her in some places. I will change accordingly.",book
"""There have been so many times when I was scared to speak up because I was afraid somebody would think I was crazy. But I've learned that lesson now, the hard way. You have to speak the thing that you're feeling, even if it scares you. You have to tell your story. You have to raise your voice.""What a heartbreaking story. Whatever you feel about Britney this memoir makes you understand and have empathy for all the things that have made headlines in her life. It took me a little bit to get into it because though people believed this was going to be ghostwritten, I believe the editors tried to keep it raw and in her voice so it does jump around a little bit and the flow can be off, but it feels authentically Britney. I got to a point where I couldn't put it down...and then there were parts I had to put it down because it was very difficult to read what she went through.I don't think I will look at any of her past interviews or performances the same and I wish her the best.In speaking of when her family forced her into a mental health facility after refusing to do a second tour in Vegas and wanting to change up dance moves in a performance:""God must have been with me through that period of time. Three months into my confinement, I started to believe that my little heart, whatever made me Britney, was no longer inside my body anymore. Something bigger must have been carrying me through, because it was too much for me to bear alone. I look at the fact that I survived and I think, ""that wasn't me; that was God.""",book
"The media could not be loaded. I personally have been in the same exact situations as some of these in Britneyâs memoir. My sonâs father illegally withheld my son from me for 72 days when I have primary physical custody and sole legal custody. The police wonât take a child from a parents care regardless of court order! The court system is a joke and didnât help at all. I am an unemployed single mother, so I didnât have a lawyer and no one in my family would help me because my parents donât have that kind of money and my nana and pop passed away. (All I have) It wasnât until I filed an emergency hearing after all my other petitions were denied, to finally be seen at court to get my son back. The father even then refused so eventually after educating myself online for 65 days and countless hours of research, I made a petition asking the judge for police to use force as necessary to ensure I get my son back this time. A little more than a week later the judge granted it. The pain, emotional turmoil, absolute defeat, despair, depression, anxiety, grief, guilt, helplessness, and being put down by everyone you thought was family and loved you. I didnât do anything wrong either. I had my son 24/7 with NO help from anyone, his whole 5 years of life. Working side jobs taking care of an old woman and cleaning dirty toilets to provide what he needed. Those sleepless nights crying wondering why this happened, what your child is thinking or being told, if he thinks he was abandoned when youâre showing up with police escorts and every day fighting to get your child back, but your son doesnât know that! In my situation, that whole petty situation was over my jealous sister trying to get me kicked out to take my room (master bedroom, my sons bedroom, and a master bathroom) I spent $7,000 renovating (old neglected house) and the father not wanting to pay child support, so they ganged up on us to be vindictive at the stake of my sons emotional and mental well-being. ($170 every two weeks only visits dad 6-8 days a month depending on how many weeks are in the month) People are CRUEL! You are only as good as you are giving. Once your hand closes, you will have NO ONE! My son is still struggling 5 months later with the emotional turmoil from the trauma they caused him. Heâs having outbursts in school because of the trauma! I still am also traumatized every time his visitation at his father comes. I worry Iâll never see my child again, and yes sometimes it makes me want to hide him too! For anyone to judge you and your choices when you were literally helpless walking through the gates of hell and trembling with every step, taking every single low blow, and still not giving up. Doing it all alone, no help! Evil experiences almost always revolve around MONEY and EVIL PEOPLE! You are INVINCIBLE! No one will ever understand until they walk in those shoes. Donât you ever underestimate your resilience and strength. You are strong, you are amazing, you are beautiful, you can do it! What those people did to you, that were supposed to love you but instead used you to profit off your hard work, prosperity, and dedication, I hope karma comes for them HARD. I can not imagine the trauma you have been through, especially living under a microscope with hundreds of dangerous paparazzi men hungry for money and seeing your grief and pain, profiting off your downfall when you were on top of the world, chasing you and your children around with such disrespect and disregard to how that would affect your children and your emotional and mental health, is disgusting. You were put in fight or flight mode, given ptsd, betrayed, and locked up like a prisoner. While everyone took all of your money you worked hard for, building your empire for the family you always dreamed of creating. Please stay strong, and keep fighting for your happiness. You deserve to live the life of your wildest dreams, you deserve to be the happy woman that got to enjoy doing what she loved! You deserve to do what you want when you want! You are worth it! You know who you are, what youâve done, and what YOU ARE CAPABLE OF! Now pick up that crown ð QUEEN OF POP, scream you WONâT GIVE UP, and WIN!ð¤ð»â¤ï¸ð¥³ð",book
"I have been a fan of Britney's music since the '00s. She is just a couple years older than me. I didn't love how she dressed or how sexy she was on the TV screen, because I felt like I was expected to look and act just like her - at the time. She definitely influenced fashion and hair and young women's actions. However, that is not entirely her fault.The paparazzi was INSANE around her. There were so many tabloids and photos taken of her throughout the years that by the time I reached age 17 or 18, I refused to purchase or even PICK UP a magazine while standing at the store checkout- in solidarity with Britney. What they did to her was disgusting, invasive and abusive. It makes my skin crawl, just thinking about it.But, her music was fire. The mixture of dub step rhythms with her music was so fun and energetic. I still listen to it from time to time and dance.The book was written pretty simply. You can see that she has done some therapy and has gained some insight into her life, her history. She is trying to understand why she did the things she did and why she trusted those she trusted. The kinds of betrayals she has endured in the past two decades will need some serious CBT to re-write those neuropathways into a healthier train of thought.Our society is still learning what entails ""abuse"" and what does not. I've definitely felt my share of emotional and psychological abuse. It hangs inside of your thoughts long after you've stopped being around those people. You must be constantly diligent to stop those negative thoughts toward yourself and to re-write what your mind says to you. You hear what your mind tells you WAY more often than you hear negative words from others. You are with YOU 100% of the time. There's nowhere to run. So, you need to become your own best friend.I hope this book was written by her and that she is receiving the payments from purchases. I hope that she wrote it and it was done with her consent. I find the timing of the release of this book crucial- but, maybe if I was released from ""prison"", I would run to publish my side of the story, too. I would have probably been writing in journals the entire time.I hope she heals. She seems to be on her way. I hope she simplifies her life and stops letting outsiders inside of her mind. The book was easy to read, doesn't get TOO DEEP into her psyche. It is very surface level. She is TELLING her story. it's not super deep or introspective or thought provoking in any particular way. I am definitely confused as to why the conservatorship was done in the first place, and then held for 13 years- but I was already informed about that before the book. I read the book in 2 and 1/2 hours.Many times, I wished that she would tell more details of one story or other. But, so much of her life has been an invasion of privacy, that I understand maybe she doesn't want to allow more than just the surface level story out there. It's her choice.",book
"Whether or not youâre a fan, itâs a great read. Britney takes you in her world and shares her perspective of how hateful the tabloid, tv hosts, and paparazzi was, and still is, to her. The vile, hateful, ignorant comments towards her that people got away with in the 2000âs is incomprehensible really. All the while she stood tall taking every blow and silently suffered through it. She was always perceived as dumb but I never thought that, she carried herself with dignity and gave everyone respect even if they didnât reciprocate it. From what Iâve gathered by reading her words, she didnât have a enough people in her corner looking out for her. The struggles she shared about motherhood I felt so connected to, itâs difficult enough experiencing it in the comfort of your own home with people who love you and care about you, but to experience that all while the world was watching and scrutinizing everything you do seems agonizing. Society still sets impossible standards for women and mothers. But men can do something as simple as take their kids to school and be sung as heroes. The judgment you feel amongst your own community of fellow parents is hard and can really make you second guess yourself as a parent, but on the scale of a celebrity, it seems impossible to do any good or anything right. I canât ever imagine putting my kid through any of the horrible experiences her own family put her through. But not everyone is fit to be a parent, and from what Iâve read her parents fit that mold very well. Overall it is an exceptionally well written book and full of quirky humor that sheds a warm light on the Britney I grew up watching, loving, and admiring. Her strength and grit is unmatched. I hope this gives her solace and she thrives from this point on to find herself.",book
"I had to finish the book in a week, because I needed breaks. Although it's a quick-read - it reads lyrical, like her music, very catchy and vivid, it's dark, like the color of the cover.If everything stated in the memoir is true, shouldn't her father and his posse be arrested, or at least sued for fraud or abuse?Is it just me or do her parents resemble Jefferey Epstein and Ghislane Maxwell who kept Britney as a ""sex slave"" for 13 years, just to use her body to create cash flow?Why is it when she's flying solo the families fell apart (parents divorced, sister tried to disown them), and when she's under conservatorship her family got reunited (parents got back together, watching Criminal Minds every night; and sister and father bonded).When she became an icon, she became a ""thing"" people would judge or vent on. She never had a life, and because of that, her growth, or womanhood, was stunted. She talked about what meant ""everything"" to her, music, family, sons..., It's saddening to learn that, in the end, the simple desires of having ""everything"" almost killed her. It became worse when she had no one to help. Or maybe people were just preoccupied with their own struggles, as always.Among her ordeal, she noted people she drew inspirations from, Madonna, J.Lo, Reese Witherspoon..., and the ""woman"" in her that had been suppressed for decades.That's what happened. Not fair and horrific. Her kind soul and eager for happiness eventually set her free from imprisonment. Hope she will make up and catch up with life.",book
"The world has had access to Britney Spears' memoir for one week and bookstagram is flooded with opinions and reviews. But since this is the latest KAYCE 5 STAR I have to tell you why and leave you MY full review:I've been a Britney fan since day one and have seen the relentless paparazzi coverage of her for 20 years. Everyone has an opinion on Britney, judge her and think they know everything based on what they've seen in magazines and online. Finally speaking for herself, this memoir tells us about all those stories we think we knew but from HER perspective.While the memes and reels about Justin are pretty funny since this came out, Britney went through a very traumatic experience with him (you know the one) and our girl held that in for TWENTY YEARS. And why wouldn't she? That's an incredibly personal decision and all the while, the media villainized her and praised him. I really don't care what Justin thinks about Britney's revelations. He made his choices then and she's making her choices now. Never once does she victimize herself but simply tells us how she felt through all the ups and downs. Personally and professionally.You get fun stories too about her favorite album, favorite performances, celebs she admires and more. Britney admits she is not good at fame (girl, we know and none of us would be either). If Britney never gets on another stage for the rest of her life I wouldn't blame her for one second. But given how healing music is for her, I wouldn't be surprised if we got more music one day. And if it's on her terms I bet it will be the best she's ever released.Since THE WOMAN IN ME is just 275 pages I thought it would feel short and unfinished but she did a great job recapping up to present day. She's so brave and stronger than she realizes and her love for her sons is on every page. Cheers to Britney, may she continue to heal and surround herself with people who love her and don't want to use or exploit her. She still has her beautiful heart despite everything and I think that's a huge testament to her strength.Highly recommend my bestie's memoir. 5 stars!",book
"I absolutely adored every minute of this audiobook! While the stories are heart-wrenching and even somewhat uncomfortable to hear, you have to admire the sheer amount of bravery and fortitude it took for Britney to finally sit down and tell her side of the story. Is it the, as a court would say, ""the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?"" We'll never know, because we are the outside spectators to these stories, many of which we're only hearing for the first time. Many of the stories that are contained within these pages are so steeped in lore and speculation that discerning the actual truth would be about as likely as proving the existence of God or coming up with a satisfactory solution to the abortion issue. What is true about this book, however, is that its existence will allow for a bigger conversation to take place, not just around the issues of mental health, but of the sensationalization of media coverage, the brutal realities of being a ""wind-up doll"" for public consumption, and the ethics of a mental health conservatorship. I applaud Britney, as well as Michelle Williams, for both bringing this book, and these stories, to both light and life. I recommend that anyone who has ever been curious about Britney's life, or any of the other concepts I've mentioned, read this book immediately and often!",book
"Her life and story told in her words. Britney Spears has had an expansive career and her face has been splattered on many covers of magazines accompanied by stories that photos and showed whatever it took to make those people rich. They were never telling her story.Britney tells the story of her life with raw honesty. She speaks of happiness, joy, sadness, trauma, love, rejection, rumors, heartache, and being used by so many people around her. People who should have loved, protected, and guided her. Her early days when she truly felt joy in the music and dance. How that became an escape for her. She talks about her love life, setting records straight. There is no finger-pointing or blame. Just the truth about who she loved, how she loved, and her dreams for life.She talks about her boys. In a way that all mothers can relate to. Her desperation to just be able to see them, to be able to be with them. How they were used as a weapon. Used to get her to perform. Her experiences with the paparazzi how relentless and cruel they were. As a mother, I can't imagine what I would have done. Especially with newborns and having PPD.She speaks about the conservatorship. She shares the horrible things her father put her through. The fear. She asks over and over again. Why am I under this conservatorship, yet I am still working. Making money, supporting people. Why was she? A woman who wasn't able to make the simplest of choices for herself, for her body.This memoir is a quick read. It isn't Hollywood gossip. It is a story of a woman who is moving on in her faith, a survivor.I pray she finds the peace that she truly seeks.",book
"I bought the book thinking it would arrive before I left for vacation. It didnât, so I bought the audiobook as well.I listened to the audiobook non-stop. I felt every little bit of feeling listening to Michelle Williams read Britneyâs memoir. Britneyâs life is poignant, utterly devastating, and full of love and hope all at the same time. Iâve been a Britney fan since Baby One More Time. Her music brings about feelings of nostalgia from my youth, and she reminds me of everything good from that time in the early 2000âs. I saw and read in the media back then how Britney was portrayed, and how relentlessly the paps chased her, like Britney said, like she wasnât âhuman.â It was a daily thing, and I felt so devastated for Britney. People criticized her, destroyed her image, all that. Ahhh, I cried listening to this memoir. I have nothing but respect and love for Britney. She is one strong woman for coming out in one piece after what her father and the rest of her family did to her. You can feel how much Britney loves her boys, and as a parent myself, I would do anything for my kids, just as she. Britney, you are an inspiration for strength, resilience, love and hope. Girl, do not stop being you. I love you, and I will, and the rest of your loyal fans will have your back no matter what!!!â¤ï¸â¤ï¸â¤ï¸",book
"I'll admit, I rarely watched ""Friends"" when episodes first aired. My wife started binge watching it a couple years ago or so, probably during the pandemic, and so I started watching it with her. I do think that I was a little too hard on the show though as I always thought that it was a bit of a ""Seinfeld"" ""rip-off."" In reality there are enough differences in the shows that now, after watching the entire series of each, I've relaxed my criticism. A bit.And I rarely read autobiographies, or what people usually call ""memoirs"" nowadays. I usually am reading true-crime books, in particular those about serial killers. I did read ""C'mon, Get Happy: Fear and Loathing on the Partridge Family Bus"" (CGH) from David Cassidy in 2021 and I actually liked Mr. Cassidy LESS after reading his memoir. I kind of wish I wouldn't have read CGH and just remembered him instead from his time on the show. It's just that I found Mr. Cassidy to be a bit of a braggart while reading and while I finished CGH I was struggling to even care towards the end. I'm guessing that Susan Dey felt the same. Ahem.Now, rarely does Matthew Perry ""brag"" during ""Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing: A Memoir"" (FLB) about himself. He does discuss how much money he made during filming of ""Friends,"" and I don't have a problem with that, mostly because he discusses how David Schwimmer actually was instrumental in negotiating a great deal for the entire cast and not just for Mr. Schwimmer. In reality Mr. Perry is far more self-deprecating in FLB than Mr. Cassidy is in CGH. Mr. Perry doesn't seem to hide much when it comes to his struggles with addiction and if he does underplay it, well, he must be REALLY bad. Mr. Perry discusses how he was taking up to 55 pain killers a day and that is extreme. For those who don't know, pain killers tend to dry you out and slow down digestion so I have no idea how someone could take that many for any length of time and survive.Well, Mr. Perry almost didn't survive.Mr. Perry was rushed by a friend from one of his many stints in rehab to the hospital and the people running the rehab facility tried to stop him. If they had been successful Mr. Perry surely would've died. Heck, he still should've died in the hospital even though he had probably the best care that money could buy. From memory he said that only ""two percent of people survive on the machine required to keep him alive,"" and I think he also called it a ""Hail Mary.""Overall I really liked FLB and I actually read it in one day. As a matter of fact I couldn't sleep last night and kept picking up my Kindle device and would continue reading. Usually readers might say, ""I couldn't put it down!"" but I might say, ""I couldn't leave it down."" Over and over I picked up my device, opened the Kindle app, and continued from my last bookmark. Luckily for me Kindle apps save the bookmark for me and that's only one of the reasons I tend to almost only read digital. I will buy a paperback or a hardcover version but only if I MUST read a book and there is no digital version.But still FLB is not a ""perfect book,"" far from it. Towards the end I think that Mr. Perry starts to repeat himself and I got the feeling that he was on a tight deadline and just hammered out the last few chapters. I don't know if he first created an outline -- I think that all authors should do so at an early phase in writing -- but I think a good outline would've really helped create a more polished effort. It's also the case that Mr. Perry has a tendency to use too many parentheticals and that becomes a bit of a distraction for the reader.Not that it bothers me but it might bother some readers: Mr. Perry does discuss religion, or at least God, quite a bit towards the end. If religion is a turnoff, I think that FLB may not be for you. Mr. Perry does seem to think that God helped keep him alive, maybe even helped him break some addictions, and that is fine by me. I can't prove it either way, and it is Mr. Perry's memoir, so he has a right to think and write whatever he chooses. Personally, I appreciate his honesty.Mr. Perry does admit going into open houses and swiping pain meds from home sellers and that reminded me a lot of Ryan Leaf. I think that Mr. Leaf used to do the same thing and it got that ex-NFL player quite a few years in prison for it. From a legal standpoint if I were Mr. Perry, and I were writing a memoir, I think I might not have disclosed this. I am not a lawyer and I don't know what legal troubles it could cause him now.There has been quite a bit of noise about how Mr. Perry tends to ""kiss and tell"" and I think that's overblown a bit. He does discuss how he and Valerie Bertinelli made out within just a few feet of Eddie Van Halen, after Mr. Van Halen had passed out from drinking too much wine. Hey, I guess I've been there myself so I won't judge. Um, from Mr. Van Halen's perspective and not necessarily from Mr. Perry's. But Mr. Perry doesn't really dwell on it too much. I can understand how Ms. Bertinelli feels about the disclosure although of course Mr. Van Halen is no longer with us. If Mr. Van Halen were still alive I believe that Mr. Perry probably wouldn't even bring it up. Just a guess.Well, if you're a fan of ""Friends"" and Matthew Perry, and you like to read memoirs, I'll give a fairly strong recommendation for ""Friends, Lovers, and the Big Terrible Thing."" If you don't fit that criteria perhaps you might want to read something else. But if you're a fan of David Cassidy from ""The Partridge Family"" I'll recommend you pass on his memoir. Sometimes it's better to only remember the good things about your heroes, after all.",book
"I purchased Matthew Perry's book last year when it was published and have had it on my list of books to read. I finally read it yesterday in one sitting. Wow! I have never written a book review on Amazon, but after I finished reading, I felt compelled to leave a review. I knew he had a serious drug habit, but had no idea the extent of his addiction. It was difficult to read parts of the book, but I could not put it down. I have watched Friends for years and still watch the reruns, and it was always obvious to me how much his physical appearance was affected by his drug and alcohol use (having family members with this disease). I found the book actually exhausting to read - just when I thought it could not get worse, it did. I think it is so sad that he had such a tormented life, right from the beginning, and he was never truly able to enjoy his success. I was so sad to hear of his passing at such a relatively young age, but not really surprised (even though his cause of death has not yet been determined). After reading this brutally honest memoir, I find it surprising that he lived as long as he did - I was shocked to learn the extent of abuse his body endured. It's not the same watching Friends now, knowing he's gone and knowing what he went through while on the show. Rest in Peace Matthew - thanks for all the laughs.",book
"I just finished Mathew's book. I did not realize until I was almost done with his story that it could have been my father's story accept, my father died after getting septic from colon cancer surgery. He too had a fistula and they gave him liquids which spilled out and killed him. Dad drank, smoked, and took all the same drugs Mathew did. My Dad rejected AA because of step two. My Dad had an irrational fear of ""insanity"". My father saw shrinks and they gave him drugs to treat the fear and anxiety. My Dad had seven children with four different woman and many woman on the side. Mathew, my Dad and myself were abandoned at a critical time when we were vulnerable children. I think my Dad, Mathew and I were and are driven by the desire to have that feeling of safety and comfort we lost early in life if it ever really existed. Maybe we are trying to find that feeling of safety and comfort we imagine only exists for others. I also believe that that 'feeling' in the gut of anxiety and fear can be about a screwed up digestive track made worse by relationships, drugs, alcohol and cigarettes. Relationships, drugs, alcohol and cigarettes cause and treat the discomfort of fear and anxiety. These substances and behaviors seem to bring relief but only for a moment and then they make it worse. I think the absence of depression and anxiety can be from the absence of an irritable bowel and peace of mind. Mathew was born with colic his stomach was a problem from the start.This is a list of some of the substances he used.Constant crying from colic Mathew was drugged withphenobarbital so his parents could sleep.DilaudidSuboxoneValiumXanax.At one point he was addicted to six milligrams of Ativan a day.boozeOxy is what blew up Mathew's colon. The warm honey feeling he describes from the oxy paralyzes the gut bringing on depression and anxiety. At one point Mathew did sixty pills a day. My Dad suffered from Oxy. I experienced it too.All this stuff impacts mood. Depression, fear, anxiety. Fear of depression, anxiety and fear. The same feelings of abandonment, fear and anxiety a small child feels [I felt] when I became aware I was abandoned. These feelings are alive and well in Mathew's and my body and they can be triggered by 'something happening good or bad' I don't like to leave my house because just pulling out of my driveway is stressful.After reading the book I can better understand myself and my Dad. I was not present for my life and I mistreated the people I love while seeking relief from my addiction/discomfort. I even became co-dependent in recovery by trying to replace the substances with gurus. I too had the spiritual experience that made me feel completely loved and free from my insanity. It lasted until I tried to talk about it with other people who did not ""get it"". I was distracted by their lack of appreciation for what I was saying.After reading this book I feel like I have been in rehab for a week. I see my disease better. Mathew Perry lived the unbelievable nightmare of mental illness and lived to tell about it. We focus on the substance when that substance is really just an attempt to treat the real problem. Is self-awareness of the core issue enough to free oneself from the intolerable agony of having paralyzing feelings of being discarded and fearing it will happen again and again. Even if only just by the president of the PTA. Isolation is the only way I knew to protect myself from fulfilling the prophecy my sister made to me. She said I would never have any friends. I was eight years old. She was nine. I believed her. I was all alone on Rancho Drive. I had no friends not even my sister. Just the word ""friends"" can trigger my discomfort. No matter how many people I call friend I can not dispel that belief. The big secret I carry is I believe I have no value. When people treat me as though I have no value I want to die. Mathew said it annihilated him to be left. Annihilated describes the feeling I want to avoid the most. Until now I could not think of a word strong enough to convey my discomfort. Annihilation feels right. Sadly, whenever I risked talking about this belief, I was told to ""get over it"". That would be fine accept it is who I think I am. Can I just get over it?What or how would I know if I were over it?""I want God to always be there for me now, whenever I clear my channel to feel his awesomeness.""I hope you read the book.",book
"I was a fan of Matthew Perry from the beginning of Friends. He truly had such great comedic timing and he brought such life to every part he played. I had always known he had suffered from addiction and had been in rehab several times but I never realized just how horrible his addiction was and for how many years he fought it.I was so saddened to hear of his death earlier this week. I hope he continued to be sober and enjoy life as he stated he was at the end of this book. It's so sad that someone that had seemingly all their dreams come true, starred in a once in a lifetime show, and was so accomplished was also so miserable during all of it that he never enjoyed it. He was a great talent and will be missed.",book
"So, I will review this as two people: A writer and masters of writing student and as a fan of Matthew Perry:Hey Matthew,So, we know you can write. At least I knew you did, after I had read interviews on Mr. Sunshine a bunch of years back. You wrote a sitcom, so I knew you could probably put words together. I am glad I read this as someone who is currently reading for a degree. We have been taught to analyze, something I just do now no matter what I read, and this one was interesting. It began well enough, and your words were put together nicely. I usually like it when we move back in forth time, but in this instance, it was little too much, especially considering we changed places so often: California, to New Mexico, to Switzerland, to New York. It was time AND place jumping, which in writing, you have to do very carefully. What bothers me, is editors should have picked this up. There should have been better breaks between time/place changes and or labels (you could have been very creative here, like using the ""Friends"" way of labeling, 'The One where My Colon Explodes' or 'The one where I tried to get sober in Switzerland'.) I wish I could have been an editor on this book. It would have made a little more sense. You're supposed to write with the audience in mind, and I don't know if this is what happened. Seemed like it was more of a therapy assignment for you. But what do I know? I once got into a fight without taking my hoops out. Sometimes I don't know jack.The thing with memoirs is, that you can't write this in a way that constitutes a running thought because we're getting real facts with dates. As it turns out, the two most important things in the book (And why we wanted to read about your life) were a little too muddy to always keep straight. If you have to re-read to understand something multiple times, it becomes less and less fun to read. Running thoughts are great when you talk about the hook ups and minute details, but the structure was missing for the meat and potatoes (ya dig?) I write fiction, but we can also use the same ideology that we do use there: that there are rules, even within non-fiction writing, that things can be said too much and all at once. We want to know how 'Matty' (can I call you that?) talks about addiction. The horrors of addiction are real and true, and any addict knows this, but there should have been (editing? paging an editor...) a little more of an even grading downwards. Jumping off preverbal non-fiction cliffs is never fun. It's like jumping from the snow to the hot tub.I'm not sure why people are shocked that you talk about sex either. You're a nice-looking guy on TV with boatloads of cash. Of course, you got laid. Of course, women throw themselves at you and OF COURSE you were emotionally unavailable. If I have learned anything from this book, was that you weren't lying when you said, in fact, that you WERE Chandler. But I get peoples points. I mean, we got the assignment that you were a horny TV star. And then we just kept on getting it. (7,7,7,7) Redundancy. She's a *****. we want to get a point across, but then, what's too much?As a fan of yours (comedy in general), I don't think it's ever a good idea to read too much about people you admire from afar. I will never know you, and you will never talk to me in my life, so this book is all I have to go by. Yes, you were selfish (you call yourself that several times), but one thing that surprised me most, is when you spoke on how you would trade the money and the fame with your friend living in the rent-controlled apartment living with Diabetes. Considering how much you spent on treatments, and literally paying people to help you get clean, you had resources most addicts will ever see a 1/8th of. While you say you're grateful in the book, and I know you're trying to get the point across that ""fame doesn't fix you"", there are millions of people that would give their left um, thing, to be in your shoes, with access to Switzerland, hot nurses and new teeth (I can't even afford one implant). There is a reality missing from this that doesn't quite touch the rent-controlled tenant. This is coming more from the side of over-celebrity that most of us will never even remotely see. That chasm is large, and your perspectives after thirty years of fame are so far on the side of Hollywood, that not having money seems better. (It's not. Money won't fix everything, but it eases burdens. Ask me what my husband and I argue most about.)The title of this book should be, ""The One Where the Grass is Always Greener.""Matthew. Write another book. I would love to see a comedic novel from you based loosely on your life. You would get to use the words ""based on a true story"". You CAN write, I saw that. And while you have spent your life chasing other people's opinions, and mine shouldn't matter, consider it. There is so much untapped creativity there that it makes me crazy. Be grateful you have the platform you do and you're not a mom stuck in the burbs like me. Oh, and call Craig, and maybe pay for his Diabetes medication.That's all I have. I thank you for opening yourself up and spilling the ugly out. That's never easy. Sorry for the honestly, but then, no one care what I think anyways.Be well, Bing-a-ling.P.S- Does Yemen have a nice view?",book
"It is no secret that I am a huge Friends fan. So when Matthew Perry died last week, I decided to open up his book. I have had it since it came out just have not read it. I havenât been able to bring myself to watch an episode of Friends since his death. Friends is an escape for me, and itâs not easy to escape when thereâs such a great sadness right now. This book is raw. What he went through with drugs and alcohol was so incredibly difficult. But the other thing that really took me by surprise was how raw he is about his relationship with God. I so appreciate that he included that in his book. I get so used to reading books by Christian authors where everything is just âwonderfulâ. But his rawness about his struggles has really helped me to find a peace with his death. Definitely a reread.",book
"I wasn't going to read this book, having seen previous reviews which mentioned it was heavy and dark. Not really my thing. But then Perry passed away and I couldn't not pick up this book. And I think, previous to his passing, I wouldn't have found this book to be too heavy or dark. I think it shines light and hope on a tough topic. It made me really see something I had no idea was there. It was riveting and interesting. And it ended with such hope. Hope which has been crushed with this most recent news. And with that comes crushing sadness. Instead of hope, I just feel bad for him. All those hopes and dreams he had for himself, all that fighting, and for what? I have no doubt he has helped, and will continue to help, many people with his comedy, his words, his story. I just feel deep sadness that he didn't get the chance to find his own HEA.",book
"What a shock to lose such a talented and funny actor so young. I know when this memoir first came out, a lot of people had a lot of not very nice things to say about Matthew Perry, but I think they didnât get it. This man had severe childhood trauma and abandonment issues that he never processed, and he was a drug addict. He really bares his soul here in this book. I have always loved Matthew Perry and I was still love him, even after reading his memoir. Iâm so sad that he never was able to permanently beat his demons. He was a talented and funny actor, and not just in Friends.I hope he is resting peacefully now. After 50 years of no sleep, here is hoping the eternal one also comes with an amazing view where he can see how much the world really did love him.",book
"I am not a celebrity memoir reading type person. I happened to watch an interview he did last year with a canadian station [maybe BBC] and truly had no idea that Matthew Perry was an alcoholic or drug addict. I decided to get the book and finished it in 1 sitting. It is well written and an easy read. I think people forget that ""celebrities"" are human too. It was a rough ride for Matthew Perry, but I am glad he was able to face his demons, become clean and sober before his untimely passing. RIP Matthew Perry!",book
"Iâm so glad I read this or I would never have known the multi-layered life of Matthew Perry. I learned so much about drug and alcohol addiction and how it affects oneâs body, mind, soul and spirit. I wish heâd never entered the world of horrors and wish heâd been able to experience true peace and joy sooner. I will always love and miss Matty and am sad to have lost him so young. He never married or had children and he would have been such a fantastic father if he had beat his addictions long ago. RIP Matty!",book

"One Sunday, I was visiting blogs, which I don't get to do very often, and stumbled upon one that caught my eye. I can't remember the exact wording, but the blogger stated they didn't enjoy a book that was getting a ton of buzz and love. However she worded her comments piqued my interest, so I looked up the book on Goodreads and decided almost instantly that it sounded like something I would like. I added it to my wish list, and Husband bought it for me for my birthday. I still put off reading it for a while because I needed to focus on review books first. I finally found time to pick it up, and I have to say that I didn't want to put Fourth Wing down. We never have lazy days where we just let the kids watch TV all day, but Husband wasn't feeling well, it was 101 degrees outside, and I was enthralled. So I read every chance I got that first day and read about 80% by midnight. I needed to sleep because I knew that was too much to finish at a reasonable time for me. And I finished the other 20% the next day.Fourth Wing has everything you could want from the first release in a new fantasy series. You have a flawed leading character--Violet is fragile. Her bones break easily, her joints and ligaments are weak as well. She is short. And generally not physically strong. She is, however, brilliantly intelligent. She spent her entire life training to go to the scribe quadrant. But her mother, one of the nation's top military leaders, decrees that Violet will enter the dragon rider's quadrant instead.The rider's quadrant is a vicious school of tests and challenges that will end with more cadets dead than alive. Often times the tests kill the cadets. Just as often, the other cadets will do the killing. And what deaths remain are likely from the dragons themselves! Unique schools like this are why series like Harry Potter, Vampire Academy, Divergent, Red Rising, and even Throne of Glass have been wildly popular and universally loved.And I mean dragons! The appeal of these mythological creatures is fascinating. Perhaps because they're imaginary, we love the different iterations of dragons throughout various literature and media. Fourth Wing's dragons are some of the best I've come across, from the varieties and their discerning qualities to their ability and willingness to bond to humans. Plus, the bond enables a psychic connection with their riders. These dragons are so well done. I applaud Rebecca Yarros for her imagination and vivid depictions in bringing them all to life.The friends are an interesting variety as well. There are friendships that form almost instantly, those that have spanned entire lifetimes, those that form unexpectedly, and even ones that form begrudgingly. The personalities differ as much as the dragons and the abilities they bestow upon their riders. Violet's older sister, Mira, warns her against forming friendships in the rider's quadrant. Allies are important, but friendship can often be a liability. Plus, when cadets are dying more frequently than surviving, forming friendships means saying goodbye to people who have shared pieces of their hearts with you and vice versa. But Violet doesn't survive the rider's quadrant by following the path others have established. She must survive by her own instincts and her own journey through the tests and trials.Speaking of abilities, Rebecca Yarros also did an excellent job creating a wide range of abilities since there are so many different characters. None of the signets were too similar to each other. And I loved the intrigue of wondering what new talent would be gifted to the next cadet. She even forms opposite sides of a coin without it appearing to be mirror talents.The enemies were fierce. We start off with Violet being warned by her sister Mira to steer clear of Xaden Riorson because he will kill her as soon as he gets the chance as revenge for what her mother did to his father in executing the king's justice for his father's rebellion. Violet meets him almost immediately. Nearly the same time, a brutal new cadet sets his sights on her as an easy target to weed out the weak links. Only Violet embarrasses the new cadet, and he swears revenge that he will kill her. And he's not the only person she ticks off during her first year. Xaden is hard to read. He forces Violet into his wing since he's a wingleader. He bounces back and forth between giving her advice that will help her survive, ignoring her completely, and sending others to her in ways that could be construed either for or against her.Of course, the driving questions are about whether Violet will survive each challenge she's faced with. If she does, will a dragon want to bond with her? At least until you get to a point where you have answers to these questions, and then you want to know what will happen next. I can't reveal those questions to you as they'd be spoilers.Favorite quotes:-""They choose for reasons they don't see fit to share with us."" He pushes off his desk. ""And not all strength is physical, Violet.""-You are not attracted to toxic men, I remind myself...I had to laugh at that one.-""One does not live a century without being well aware of the space one takes up.""-""Justice is not always merciful.""-""I know you just want to keep me safe,...,""I whisper. ""But keeping me safe is also keeping me from growing, too.""-""I will hate you for this."" ""Yeah."" He nods, a flash of pure regret crossing his face as he draws away. ""I can live with that.""-""Andarna is my favorite.""-""You can ride me when the flesh rots off my bones, wingleader.""-""Whatever you feel is natural. Allow yourself to feel it, but then let it go.""-""...if we let fear kill whatever this is between us, then we don't deserve it.""-""One generation to change the text. One generation to choose to teach that text. The next grows, and the lie becomes history.""I was so disheartened when I finished Fourth Wing and went to go purchase Iron Flame only to find that it wasn't released yet. The unique school setting where the cadets die more often than survive. The friends. The enemies. The romance. The DRAGONS. All of it was exactly what I look for in a series. Now, I will say that once the characters leave the setting of the school and undoubtedly have to face the corrupt government, things have the potential to go south like series such as Divergent and The Hunger Games. We shall see if The Empyrean series can survive the traps that other series before it fell into or will it thrive similar to series like Red Rising and Throne of Glass. That being said, Fourth Wing gets 4.5 Stars. Have you read Fourth Wing? What did you think? Let me know!",book
"** Spoilers **Oh, my goodness this book is captivating! It had me hooked from the beginning!Let's get into it!Violet - Love her! She is super smart and figures things out quickly. She is witty and spunky. She loves and protects so many people. She makes so many friends along her journey and protects them ever chance she needs to. She finds friends from her past, Dain. (Which I'm sorry if you do like him, I didn't like him from the very beginning.) Then she finds, Rhiannon, Ridoc, Liam, Sawyer and more. Even with Jack, he was a total ass to her, crazy trying to kill her and she still felt bad that she killed him to protect her friend. She stays in her own lane and works hard to prove that she can be a rider. To prove to her mother and everyone else that she can and will. So, she conquers all of these challenges. She becomes a rider! Not only does she pair with one dragon but two! Tarin and Andarna! To add Tarin is mated to a dragon Sgaely which is Xaden's dragon! Connect Violet and Xaden even more than the automatic connection they already have. Let's talk about that! The one person she is told to stay away from is the ONE GUY she falls for!! Of course, kind of an enemies to lovers going on. Yay! I instantly love Xaden and Violet together. Even when she kept thinking he was going to kill her. I thought no way they're going to end up together or connected one way or another.Xaden - Total bad-boy vibes, of course. But hides his true feelings for Violet. Also, the fact that he took over the full responsibility of all the rebel children and had them in scripted into Basgiath to either prove loyalty becoming riders and fight for Navarre or die trying. Better than all of them being killer because their parent were rebels. He is a complete protector, he protected Violet every chance he was given but also hid it very well. I am annoyed that he had to be hiding some kind of secret! Why couldn't he just tell her everything?? I mean truly I get why he didn't but why? lol. Then this whole time he was hiding his true feelings from her. But then it comes out at the very end when he thinks she is going to die.Other side notes:Back to Dain for a bit. I don't like him. He is annoying and is always try to ""protect"" Violet but in a way that is whiny and trying to bring her down. His power is to see someone's memory. He secretly uses it on her to see what she knows about Xaden. Then he tattletales on them to his dad. Ugh. I. Don't. Like. Him.So, Violet gets two dragons. Andarna and Tarin is mated to Xaden's dragon Sgaely. That also makes it so Xaden and Violet can mind speak to each other. and Violet can also communicate with Sgaely. Then with both their signet powers they are one badass couple. Xaden (shadows), Violet (lightening). Also, how their dragons cannot be away from each other for more than 3 days. I am excited to see where this goes.Liam! I am so sad that we lost Liam. I cried so much when all of that happened. I was hoping so way that Violet could freeze time like she could with Adarna but I never did. Not only did she lose a great friend, but Xaden also lost a brother. It was so sad. I'm definitely going to miss his character.So, Xaden and some of the other rebels and dragon were working with gryphons and their fliers. Enemies of Navarre. They are giving them weapons to help fight the venin and wyvern. Violet is completely in the dark about this until the end of the book. These people she thought were a complete fantasy. Her father told her stories from a book, he leaves her a hidden letter in the book basically telling her that these people and creatures are real, and their government is hiding the truth from their people. Then at the very end of this book someone believed to be dead is actually ALIVE! He is part of the rebellion! I knew something happened at the end due to other people's reactions, but I never thought that, that would be it! definitely a good twist!I cannot wait for November when the 2nd book comes out!",book

"I saw the hype for this book everywhere and I saw MANY of my all time, auto buy authors RAVING about this story. So my expectations were set at an all time high.I was 1,000% not disappointed!! I legit read this book in 12 hours. In one day I started and finished this book, and while I consumed it, I knew I was going to be devastated when I finished. Well, here I am devastated but also extremely happy.Also? THERE WILL BE SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW. For once I didn't read an early copy so I can say whatever I want and I'm oh so going to lol.Violet. VIOLET! I need to be her friend. She is fantastic person. So super smart, I love that she wanted to be a scribe and be surrounded by books. And her ability to retain information is amazing! Makes her the dangerous student in her school. And her the brilliant plan she came up with for each of her sparring sessions made me jump up and down with joy.Xaden. I loved him the second he learned Violets name and threatened her life. The tension between them was instantaneous and it was always sizzling between them with every encounter. For them to have waited so long to cave in to their attraction was agonizing but so worth it. Though he's really put himself into a deep hole by the end of this book. I'm really really going to enjoy seeing him pull out all the bells and whistles to gain Violets trust again. I know it's going to be even more intense I bet.I honestly despise her mother. I cannot believe she is willing to risk another child, especially considering Violet had only been training for 6 months. All because of their name and image. I would have had a few choice words for her. And then later when Violet proved herself to her mother's standards? AND HER MOTHER IGNORED HER??? Hell no. No. No. No.Another person I hate? Dain. That spineless weasel, I can't stand him. I need to be Violets friend so I can punch him and break his nose, I swear. He's only out for himself. One minute he's lecturing Violet, telling her what to do, acting like she's not 20 years old, the next he's celebrating the exact thing he was scolding her about and acting like he was responsible for it. Just because he realized that he can be associated with her and her some fame from it or something. And his ""the rules say...."" oh just shove it, Dain.The amount of people after Violet in this book is insane and that girl has so much luck on her side.Also? I loved how many people died in this book. Do not get attached to many of these characters because they drop like flies.The dragons. THE DRAGONS!!! I freaking love them. Every single second a dragon is on these pages I'm in love. Especially Tarin - he's hilarious and I love his and Violets banter!The revolution happening is going to get crazy in the upcoming books. I'm not the biggest fan of those but I'll suffer through it to continue loving these characters.Now, the biggest spoiler because I need to remember for book 2. So, you know, don't read of you don't want spoilers...I CAN'T BELIEVE BRENNAN IS STILL ALIVE!!!!!!! How did he fake his death with his mother?? Does she know? Is her mother in the dark? How mad is Violet going to be?? Her father died from his death basically and Violet loved her father. Also? This is not going to go well with Xaden keeping this from her and HE BETTER TELL HER EVERY FREAKING SECRET IN HIS LIFE!!!!! If he messed up what they have forever and she moves on to someone else I'll never forgive him.So suffice to say, this book has me obsessed and I'm about to own 4 copies - at least! The hype is worth it. I'm telling everyone to read it. And I can't wait for more!",book
"I am a reck after reading this book but in the best of ways. I cannot remember the last time I have been left this way after finishing a book to where I am not sure what to do next whether it is to pick up another book or soak in what I have just finished. I usually go with the former but this time I am probably going to do the later for a day or so. Rebecca Yarros has successfully put me in a temporary book coma. The world that Yarros builds is absolutely stunning and the structure of government and military is solid and makes sense. The characters she has created for this storyâ¦. Gah I feel like I could wright an essay on quite a few of them easily and thatâs not just counting the main character Violet. But I do connect to her the most on a pretty deep level.That connection being having a sever disadvantage in a field that doesnât do well with having just one. But she doesnât let that stop her if anything it fuels her to prove everyone wrong. I have had to do that myself and really through this book I realized I kind of forgotten to do that here recently and was reminded of that part of my self. So I really admire Violet's tenacity, determination, and adaptably in every challenge she faces. But our main character is not the only one I have strong feelings for. Yarros has this spectacular ability to get you to almost feel something for most of these characters in this book no matter how long they are in the book, and boy will you feel some feelings while reading this. So for warning feelings will be had!As for the romance and spice I have to say yet again it has been a while since I have been on edge for a relationship development in a story, but again in the best of ways. I would say slow burn is not even an adequate description for them. While yes it takes a minute for our love interests to admit their feelings with each other, the build up to that point wasnât a slow burn it was already an inferno really. Donât know how many times I sat there fanning myself and it wasnât even over a spicy scene. But another thing I have to appreciate is that the romance does not over take the main story that is being told. While the romance is to die for, other relationships that are built or building in this story also captivate you as well.Another thing about this book that I have to commemorate the author for as a critique is how she is able to get you to feel about movements and the structure of this world as well. You will feel wonder and awe along with sorrow, horror, and anger very easily as this world is developed and certain structures and systems are played out. She has artfully and skillfully found that perfect balance in getting the reader to feel for pretty much the whole entire story and every aspect of it. This is what I believe is what makes this such a great book to read. It is the fact that she does not get you to just feel for the characters in the story but she gets you to feel for everything in this story. I hope she is able to carry this through for the rest of the series because if she can then she has created something special for us and we better prepare to be recked some more for what is to come next.",book
"Rebecca Yarros has 'it' -- the gift of writing certifiable page-turners. I'm an old hand at fantasy literature, and I'm embarrassed to confess how often I robbed myself of sleep by reading 'one more chapter' in Fourth Wing past my usual bedtime. If she continues in this vein, her new series will be a commercial blockbuster. Kudos. It also qualifies as a crossover adult/YA series (more on this, later in the review).To step back and give it a critical evaluation -- for any fantasy novel or series, the first criteria is whether the world the author builds is interesting, and believable. The geography in Fourth Wing is pedestrian, but serviceable. The society adheres to the usual fantasy requirement of technological stagnation over a period of centuries. The culture in Fourth Wing, with its high level of literacy and the absence of plate armor, resembles Rome more than the usual 'medieval' setting, which is rather refreshing. Magic furnishes some quasi-modern amenities (e.g., 'mage lights' that illuminate interior rooms).The society is interesting. If Rebecca were toiling in the Star Trek novel fields, her 'Riders Quadrant' would make a nice analogue of Starfleet Academy -- in the Mirror Universe. Martial arts training is all full-contact, edged weapons included. Cadets in this elite institution routinely kill each other, with few repercussions.The human-dragon relationship is symbiotic. A human to whom a dragon chooses to bond will acquire special abilities, fueled by the dragon's magical nature. To use another Star Trek analogy, human and dragon are like Trill and symbiont -- while a dragon can survive the loss of its rider, a human, once bonded, cannot survive the death of its dragon.The aspect of the society that I most appreciated is the obvious 'secret' that the established ruling elites are ruthless bastards who carefully control the prevailing narratives to keep the masses in line and patriotic, while themselves are completely amoral. This is where Rebecca's fantasy world shines, with this resemblance to our contemporary world.The heroine, Violet, is an analogue of Rebecca herself. No fault there -- authors re-imagining themselves in their fiction has a long, and often successful, history. What makes Violet interesting is that Rebecca has replicated her own, very difficult medical challenges in her heroine. (This is surely the first work of fiction in which forms of the word 'subluxation' occur repeatedly.) I give her credit for this, for it makes Violet more interesting (I can't help but be reminded of Moorcook's Elric, whose physical weakness from his albinism is compensated for only by drugs, or the possession of Stormbringer).I have a few literary criticisms, none of which will detract from (indeed, they'll probable add to) the series' appeal. For example, applicants to the death factory that is the Riders Quadrant are almost puppy-dog eager to get in -- seemingly unoppressed by the reality that three-quarters of them (if I remember correctly) will die during training. They also look and talk like contemporary Zoomers. This is part of the YA appeal of the books, but it's a bit of a stretch to imagine contemporary Zoomers cheerfully signing up for such a place! The sex scenes are painstakingly detailed, with truly anatomic precision. For a YA audience, I suppose this might be useful information, but for an adult reader, they become tedious rather quickly.Congratulations, Rebecca. I look forward to receiving my pre-order of Flame Wing . . . :)",book
"Guys. Iâm not lying here: 2023 is MY YEAR for reading. I cannot tell you how many books Iâve read that have been so astonishingly beautiful and amazing and overall top tier. This novel is no exception.Coming into this book, I wasnât sure what to expect. The only other book Iâve read by Rebecca Yarros is The Things We Leave Unfinished. Also amazing, but if youâve read it you know itâs on a completely different playing field than this book. I mean, Fourth Wing is on a different world and isnât a historical romance novel. It is epic, though, and Iâm not using that word lightly.Fourth Wing is a fantasy novel set in the world of Navarre where dragons, griffins, and magic are real. If youâve followed a majority of my reviews on my blog, you know that I hardly ever review fantasy novels. I honestly think the only other fantasy novel Iâve reviewed was The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue, which honestly was a real world fantasy, so wasnât that far outside of my realm. With that being said, this book is outside of my typical comfort zone but holy hell did I love it. Now Iâm thinking Iâve been missing out on all of these amazing fantasy novels and I might just go on a binge.So, what exactly did I like about this novel? Everything. But to break it down: the world building that went into writing this is absolutely insane and makes it an amazing read in itself; the characters that donât necessarily make you think âoh this againâ with the main heroine; the unbeatable plot; and the beautiful, comical writing style that Rebecca Yarros demonstrates.The world building speaks for itself, but the characters that donât follow typical patterns particularly made me like this novel. For instance, our main heroine, Violet, is way weaker than other riders. She doesnât fit the mould. While this is typical for our main character, what follows isnât. Instead of her beating all odds and becoming the strongest rider of all, she basically justâ¦ adjusts. She has to do things differently and doesnât just become a natural born rider. Itâs amazing and youâll know what Iâm talking about if youâve read the book.The plot is just like what I said: unbeatable. You have foreshadowing, a romantic subplot, tension and high stakes throughout the entire novel, and man is it satisfying. Iâm not sure how long this series is going to be, but I am here for it.Lastly, Rebecca Yarrosâ writing style in this novel is nothing short of spectacular. You get epic battle scenes, romantic moments that play with your heart, and comical snips that make you laugh out loud. It really does have everything and I was thoroughly entertained throughout the entire novel.Overall, this review is huge but I had a lot to say. I honestly canât even point to something that I disliked about this novel, which just goes to show you how much I loved it and how great I think it is. If you enjoy fantasy novels, youâll fall in love with this book. If you donât enjoy fantasy novels? Youâll still fall in love with this book. Iâve already recommended it to my book club, my mom, and my brother. Yâall are welcome.Favorite quote: âAnd when others are quick to stand in front of me, Xaden always stands at my side, trusting me to hold my own.â",book
"1st person/single pov (with end chapter from alternate pov)Spice: 3.5/5Welp - I get it now. All the hype surrounding this book had me not only excited to read it but nervous as well because I know from experience that some books have a big following but they don't always live up to my expectations once I read them. Yeah, not a single doubt about this one now. In fact, it surpassed what expectations I had before opening it. My husband even read it (and he doesn't read stuff like this at all lol) and loved every minute of it! He finished and ran straight to audible to preorder the second book before I could myself! ðThis is the first I've read from this author and I liked how the world-building was written to give you enough to completely picture their environment but not so much that it became boring or felt like it was added just to fill a chapter. The character development was phenomenal and drawn out at a pace that felt natural, never forced or rushed in order to get them where they needed to be for the end of the book. (Speaking of the end of the book - I'll definitely be coming back to that one later!) And there is spice... I don't know why but I wasn't expecting the spice that I got from it. Then I got to it and hellooooooo Shadow Daddy!!! ð¤¤ I assumed there would be some flirting and some fade to black stuff but nope - Rebecca gave us a full-on adult fantasy complete with tension, steam, and chemistry. Plus, it was the perfect amount. Not too much and not too little. ð¤ð»My favorite thing though, besides the killer storyline going on here, is the little moments of humor and found family sprinkled throughout. I love it when I can laugh with the characters in a book even if chaos and/or danger is surrounding them. Humor and sarcasm are coping mechanisms for me so this not only had me engrossed in the story but it left me feeling like these characters were more alive than just words on a page.As for the ending... let me just say that I never saw it coming. I usually can spot the twists a mile away and I did in fact spot one of them but that wasn't the biggest one. It wasn't the bombshell dropped at the last possible minute that made waiting for the next book torture even though it will be here in like a week or so lol. I don't know how all of these people who read this when it came out haven't gone mad with the wait because it's only been days for me and I'm still trying not to scream over it anymore!So if you're about to jump into this one just buckle up. It's full of action, laughs, drama, secrets, suspense, passion, and so much more. Once you get to the last 20ish percent or so don't make any plans that will cause you to put this book down because you will wish you hadn't. I'm telling you I could not function like a normal adult until I finished it. I was angry, I was shocked, I bawled my eyes out (I mean why Rebecca? Just WHY?!), I swooned all over the place, and then my head exploded with six little words... ð¤¯Enjoy!!!",book

Everyone is so quick to finish this book and say ââItâs amazing!â and âThis is the best thing I have read in a long time.â Well, Iâm here to tell you that Fourth Wing was amazing and it is probably one of the best things I have ever read. Yea, I said it. Yea, I totally mean it!We follow Violet, a woman with chronic illness, and her journey in war college where everyone is a target. There isnât enough dragons for the amount of cadets accepted and there isnât a rule against âvoting people off the islandâ. We watch Violet grow from former scribe student to full on dragon riding badass with a group of close knit cadets and a love interest that either wants to kill her for past actions or help her become the warrior she is.I literally can not stop talking about this book. I am a sucker for great writing style and in depth description and Fourth Wing had it. This book is very much a love story, but if felt like a book about Navarre, its history, its laws, its war and there HAPPENS to be this influential love story of the most powerful riders of all time going on at the same time. I LOVED that! This book is so rich with this countryâs history, dragon laws, and lore, you feel like a citizen of this fictional place.My favorite character was most definitely Violet. Itâs been a hot minute since I read a true, from the get-go strong female character. She came out on the first few chapters holding a middle finger in the air to anyone who underestimated her. She didnât stand her ground with just words, she acted upon it in multiple badass moments. We watch her grow stronger, work through her weaknesses, make her sacrifices, but also never lose her empathy. That empathy helped her find a group of friends that became her allies and helped her soar.Yarrosâ writing is absolutely stunning. She was able to keep a medium pace story going while also telling us about multiple locations and their people, dragons and their descriptions, battles, etc. It practically played cinematically in my mind. Yarrosâ words transport you to Basgiath War College and made you a side character that observed the life changing and world altering story of Violet Sorrengail. And that cliffhanger!! I can not wait for the next book coming out in November 2023.",book
"I first came across Fourth Wing when I noticed it in the #1 position on Amazon's Best Science Fiction and Fantasy of 2023 So Far. But beyond that selection, I looked at how the reviews were trending. At the time, there were more than 21,000 reviews (it's now about to crest 40,000), and the average was a whopping 4.8 stars. It has to be good for that many people to love it, right? In need of a palate cleanser after the difficult read that was The Whispers, I decided I'd limit the likelihood of another clunker and see what all the hype is about. And I'm happy to say that I get why so many people love this book: it's pretty great.Fourth Wing is set at Basgiath War College in the mythical land of Navarre. It opens on Conscription Day, where thousands of twenty-year-olds assemble to take their place among the healers, scribes, or infantry. The most elite of them try to join the most selective branch and become dragon riders.Our heroine is Violet Sorrengail. Bookish and smart, yet frail, she always imagined a future as a scribe, just as her father had been. But her mother is a rider and a general in the army, and she has other ideas. Against Violet's wishes, her mother insists she attempt to be a rider as well. But this isn't an idle push in a different direction. The stakes are the highest possible for those trying to become riders: from the opening conscription challenge through bonding with a dragon, there are dozens of opportunities to fail, and any failure when attempting to become a rider equals death.In addition to the general peril of the tasks at hand, there is also a ruthlessness among the members of the War College. Fewer classmates means better opportunities to bond a dragon, and so the murder of fellow classmates, while perhaps not encouraged, is certainly allowed, making every waking moment one filled with potential death. Yarros creates an interesting caste within the college of students who carry ""rebellion relics"". They are the children of adults involved in a rebellious uprising six years prior. All of the adults were executed, and the children were only spared execution as well by being forced into conscription as riders. As a result, they all tend to possess a brooding darkness -- you could think of them as the ""Slytherin"" of Basgiath. To further complicate things for Violet, those children of the rebels all intensely hate her because Violet's mother was responsible for ordering their parents' execution.The novel is packed with a ton of genre-bending elements. There is the basic plot -- Violet's unlikely journey through her first year at Basgiath War College -- which stirred up memories of one of my all-time favorite books, Pat Conroy's The Lords of Discipline, based on Conroy's first year at The Citadel military college. There are dragons and dragon riders, which of course evokes memories of plenty of fantasy novels, with Anne McCaffrey's Dragonriders of Pern series top of mind. And then there's some romance, and a potential love triangle, which starts out feeling like something from a YA novel, but ends up a lot more R-rated and steamy, and more akin to what you might find in a novel with Fabio on the cover. Add to this a nuanced backstory and some misdirection on who the reader should trust and believe, and Fourth Wing truly has something for everyone.There is depth to the story and characters, which elevates the story and I'm sure plays a big role in the stellar reviews. Yarros handles relationships well, whether it's the strained relationship between Violet and her mother, the love between Violet and her sister, or the friendships Violet forges with her classmates. The romance is the romance; honestly I could have done without it, and while it was almost humorous at times, it works for what it is meant to be. Yarros also does a standout job of presenting how her characters handle loss. Whether it's grieving the loss of family members or their classmates, there is an undercurrent of sadness and longing that affects many of the characters and hardens them to the task at hand. Despite the intensity of their training, Yarros does a pretty good job reminding us that they're only in their early twenties and still figuring out a lot of life.I suspect a lot of the hype and enjoyment of the book is related to how Yarros turns a straightforward ""year 1 as a student story"" into something more. I can't help but compare that to the Harry Potter books (except, of course, Harry never had hot magical sex with Ginny Weasley -- at least not within the pages of any of the books!). Those novels changed significantly for me with the third book in the series, The Prisoner of Azkaban. Where books 1 and 2 were decent and straightforward YA novels, The Prisoner of Azkaban took the story to a more nuanced and mature level. Yarros does the same thing here, but all within the pages of a single book. I get why people are so drawn to the story.Overall, it's a winner. It's fun, and while it feels derivative of several other novels, it also combines those stories and plots in its own unique way. Book 2, Iron Flame, is already set for release this November (I've already ordered my copy!), and so if you fall in love with the characters, you'll have the opportunity to spend more time with them before long (well, at least with those who survive Fourth Wing). It's a compelling read and like the other 40,000+ readers who have this trending at almost 5 stars, I don't think you'll be disappointed.",book
"I was very excited for this new book to come out. I am a HUGE fan of this series and have been reading it for years. I just finished reading it a few minutes ago (it came in mail yesterday afternoon) and I already am waiting to see what happens to Greg next. I have every single book in the whole series and I care about these characters a lot. I have read most of the books at least five times each.I like the series because Greg is funny and it's sort of funny how no matter what happens, he just rolls with his life. I don't really like that poor Greg never really has a ""happy"" ending. My mom says it's because the story is told from his perspective.In this book, the school is losing money because the kids are not getting good grades. This sounds crazy, but it can really happen! So, the school decided to give rewards to kids who got higher grades. The robot cleaner in the book reminded me of the grocery store robot in my town. It's cute with its big, googly eyes.Mom Says:Reading has always been a focus in our home. We believe in reading and education and being able to research things on our own. We are teaching this foundation to our children. I spent a couple hours each DAY reading to my kids when they were little. We read the entire Harry Potter series aloud to them in 2021, before bedtime for an hour each night.Reading has always been important.Â My daughter was not a confident reader six years ago, when she was four and five years old. I got the Wimpy Kid books for her, hoping it would be entertaining enough, and easy enough, to keep her motivated to finish books.Since she read the first few books at age 5 or 6 years old, she has become a VORACIOUS reader. She reads one or two books a day now. She reads chapter books, 200-page books with no pictures in them. She is an excellent reader and I find books all over the house now, in places where she was sequestered away, enjoying a story- and it started with the Wimpy kid series.I've even sat down to read several of the Wimpy books myself. I can finish the books in 30 minutes with my morning coffee and I find myself oftentimes laughing out loud to them. I hope he keeps them light and silly- and we will keep reading them.",book
"I pre-ordered this book for my son. He was counting the days for the bookâs arrival. He loves and has all books of the collection. The hardcover is so nice and the reading of this graphic novel is a perfect fit for my son, who has ADD and Aspergerâs Syndrome, and he wonât read books that arenât graphic novels.",book
"The plot of this book is Greg's school has the lowest test scores in the state and their funding was cut. The school was falling apart, and they had to cut corners everywhere they could. Alot of the gags had me laughing out loud. A few parts are contrived but it was still super funny. Keep em coming Mr. Kinney",book
"My 11-year-old son is slightly obsessed with this series. He waited months for ""No Brainer"" to come out. We preordered back in August and received it as soon as it was released in October. My son said this was the best Diary of a Wimpy Kid book yet!",book
My 10 year old loves this book series. He is collecting all of them and was so excited to read this one as soon as it came out. It was a very easy read for him and loves the funny story line.,book
"the book is so nice! I finished the book in one night. It was about greg going to a different school in Slacksville. His school such bad grades so their school got closed.but in Slacksville, he met Larry Mack Junior.He spent lots of money to reopen the school.",book
"My son was so excited to hear a new one came out. I got this and he was finished reading in a day, told me it was so good I should read it. I've never seen him so excited over a package.",book
"I am glad the movies got me used to the art style as it is very minimalist, but well written. The scene in the pics made me laugh to imagine multitasking by leaving your brain somewhere while you have mindless fun elsewhere.",book
This was an amazing book and honestly great series. So funny and relatable. Jeff Kinney is such a talented writer and really enjoyed reading this hilarious book ð,book
Glad I can buy these books right on Amazon and get them on the day they come out. My son cannot wait for them to arrive.,book
"David Grann is one of our greatest nonfiction authors alive. Every topic he chooses is brought to life no matter how many years have passed since the events took place. His writing is smooth and unobtrusive, describing the past in a matter-of-fact, approachable way. If history books had been like this in high school, weâd all have gone on to be scholars.Killers of the Flower Moon is an especially difficult book to read, not because of the writing but because the subject is so painful. Grann documents how literally hundreds of Osage were murdered for riches in the early 20th C. As American Indians, their lives were worth less than that of dogs. An entire corrupt and venal society was arrayed against them. Well aware they were systematically being murdered, they had no recourse. The authorities, both political and legal, were complicit in the murders. No one would help save them from systematic eradication.This is an excellent telling of a dark and shameful time in our history. If only this much attention had been paid a hundred years ago some of the Osage who were murdered might have lived.",book
"Killers of the Flower Moon by David Grann is a well documented tale of the murders of 20 plus Osage Indians to steal their money. It took place in the early 1920âs and became known as the Reign of Terror. The land the Osage Indians were forced to live on was some of the richest oil reserves in the country. The Osage sold off some of the land but retained the mineral rights, thus they owned the oil. At one time they were the richest per capita people in the world.The Federal Government determined the Indian was incompetent and created a guardianship situation where a white man was appointed to oversee the expenditures of the funds. In order to spend their own money for groceries or medicine or anything, the Indian had to meet with their guardian and get permission. When the killings began, two individuals were shot and their bodies left where they fell. The sheriff didnât have any luck finding the killer. When a house blew up killing an Osage woman, her white husband, and a white maid, a group of Osage went to D.C. and appealed to the President to do something. The FBI was created to address the situation.It is a gripping story. I was reading until 3 a.m. to get to âwho done it.â It has been made into an excellent movie by Martin Scorsese but the book provides more background.",book
"Killers of the Flower Moon is the true story of the numerous murders of members of the Osage Native American tribe during the early 1920s. It was referred to as the Reign of Terror. The Osage community was incredibly wealthy because the supposedly worthless land in Oklahoma to which they had been confined since 1870 was found to contain some of the largest oil reserves in the United States. People flocked there to strip them of their wealth by any means possible including murder. The situation was exacerbated by the government policy that claimed the Osage were not competent enough to manage their money and thus White guardians were assigned to each Osage native for that purpose. This of course resulted in the guardians stealing from and murdering their clients.The deaths began with several members of the Osage community wasting away. The local doctors attributed this to illness. It was not until two members of the Osage were shot and killed that it was acknowledged that there was a plot against the Osage community, but little was done to solve those murders. When the bombing of an Osage home resulted in the deaths of three people, a new investigative group under the Federal Governmentâs Justice Department was asked to look into the murders. That department had a new director, J. Edgar Hoover. Hoover assigned Tom White to the investigation. White was successful in finding the murderers and having them prosecuted.The book also discusses the life of Tom White who truly was an amazing man. The author is very critical of Hoover. Admittedly, Hoover was a man of massive ego but he did create an agency that developed the technical expertise and methods that allowed the solving of murders previously deemed unsolvable.I rated this book 5 stars for several reasons. It is an extremely compelling story; I could barely put it down. It was very well written; the authorâs research into this Reign of Terror was immense. Nor did he did limit his investigation to this time frame. He also dug deep into the archives of Osage history to find unsolved or mysterious deaths that occurred both before and after the Reign of Terror. They were numerous. He estimated that the murders began in 1910 and continued through the early 1930âs. Lastly, it gave me an appreciation of the times in which I live. I am often very distressed about the changes occurring in society but when I compare it to that eraâs rampant corruption and violence which was present throughout the whole of society, not just the Osage community, I cannot help but believe that we as a nation have become a more just and empathetic society.",book
"KILLERS OF THE FLOWER MOON: The Osage Murders and the Birth of the FBI by David Grann is an enthralling true story of the murder, greed, and fear that permeated the Osage Indian tribe for years in 1920âs Oklahoma. This is an extensively researched look at the oil rich Osage and the prejudice which allowed white guardians to exploit the system to steal, embezzle, and murder their charges for their shares of oil rights and the newly formed FBI men who took on this murder investigation.Molly Burkhart watched as one by one her Osage family and friends were killed. Some by gunshot, some by poisoning, and others never designated with a method of death since the tribe became the richest people in the U.S. due to the oil under their land. In the 1920âs, the Osage were considered unable to handle their wealth and the Federal government decided that they should be appointed white guardians. When anyone questioned the deaths, they would mysteriously end up dead.The murder rate exceeded the national average when the government decided to send in men from the newly formed FBI under J. Edgar Hoover. At first, they did no better than the corrupt local law enforcement until Hoover sent in Tom White. He put together a team of his choosing who all entered the region undercover and soon began to piece together a conspiracy tied to the most influential rancher in the area.This book is intricately plotted not only making the characters come to life for the reader, but to show the Osage were set up to be exploited (hopefully) unintentionally by the Federal governmentâs decision that put the Osage under guardianship. The local white population took advantage of this system to follow the money and kill off family lines until the white guardians inherited the Osage money and oil rights. While this book focuses on the one conspiracy of criminals publicized in that time that were brought to trial after the FBIâs investigation, the author discusses many other murders that were never investigated. I was outraged by the prejudice, heartsick by the killing, and that is what I hope to feel and more when reading a book about a historical atrocity. The descendants of the Osage are still looking for justice and closure which will never come.I highly recommend this compelling historical true crime mystery.",book
"No spoilers here... We saw the movie (Killers of the Flower Moon) before we read the book. Both the movie and the book are excellent in that they tell an extremely important (and heretofore rather hidden) story in our ""Manifest Destiny"" duplicitous and murderous gaining of land to create this country. The movie tells the story through the life events of an Anglo man married to an Osage woman. The book tells the same story through the eyes of the FBI's unravelling of the deceit and murders that interlopers used to gain access to the money the Osage were due for the oil rights on their land. Usually I read a book before I see the related movie, but I'm glad I saw this movie first...for me, it helped to 'know' the characters while reading the book.",book
"Thank you, David Grann, for this history lesson. The more I learn of what the ""white man"" did to the indigenous peoples of the North American continent, the more ashamed I am . It is information and history we need to learn and remember so that we do not repeat it. Money and greed and power are truly crimes of their own and humanity must teach the young to care for each other. We can learn from history and be better in our leaning. Thank you for a thoughtful telling of a very dark time. I wonder, now, if anything similar happened to other tribes in Oklahoma and other states. The Miami tribe, and most others, were robbed of their ancestral homes in the 1800s. The Miamis and neighboring tribes, had mining in northeast Oklahoma. It would be interesting to know if there were murders similar to the Osage in that region. Thank you, for this research and for sharing it with the world.",book
"I just finished this book a couple of days ago. My intent was to finish the book before I saw the movie. Now, Iâm not sure I want to see the movie because there is so much going on in the book that really canât be conveyed on the screen. Reading all terrible things that were done to the Osage by whites in the guise of doing what is best for them was beyond my comprehension. Sadly, nothing has really changed. We gave them the crappiest land we could find for the Osage thinking that they would not survive. And then they did and we tried to take that from them too. How do whites atone for these crimes? How do we apologize for committing genocide on native peoples and then turning our backs in them?",book
"Killers of the Flower Moon by David GrannNew York: Doubleday$28.95 - 339 pagesâThe whites have bunched us up down here in the backwoods,the roughest part of the United States, thinking âwe will drive theseIndians down to where there is a big pile of rock and put them therein that corner.ââ Now that pile of rock has turned out to be worth millionsof dollars; now everybody wants to get in here and get some of the money.â --Osage Chief Bacon Rind.Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of David Grannâs Killers of the Flower Moon is the fact that despite the authorâs painstaking research, and his marvelous use of period photographs and documents, this factual account of historic events attending âThe Osage Murdersâ contains the atmospheric suspense and tension that is normally associated with a classic murder mystery. In fact, Grann has written a murder mystery - One that asks who methodically killed hundreds of Osage Indians during a four-year reign of terror (1920-24). Osage history reveals the tragic details of how and why. Forced to move from Kansas to Oklahoma, the Osage tribe seemed to be destined to lives of abject poverty when they suddenly found itself catapulted into a world of excessive wealth. Oil is discovered on tribal land. Suddenly, every member of the tribe is potentially wealthy. In an attempt to control the chaos that ensued, the federal government created a document called a âheadrightâ which gave each Osage household legal rights to the oil on their land. After a period of uncontrolled spending in which members of the Osage tribe acquired mansions and fleets of automobiles, the government attempted to control the excessive spending by establishing a âguardian systemâ which assigned a âlegal guardianâ to each Osage family. This âguardianâ (usually a white banker, businessmen or âcivic-minded citizenâ was given the power to approve or deny all expenditures for the Osage tribal member (who had been judged to be âincompetentâ) by the government. The system was badly flawed, and many of the guardians used their position to embezzle huge sums of money. In time, the guardian documents became bargaining chips in investing in business ventures. Hundreds of guardians used their position as a means of acting as a âmiddle-manâ who would purchase items on behalf of Osage tribal members. The guardian would then sell the item to the Osage for an inflated price. For example, guardians could purchase automobiles on behalf of the Osage tribal member for $250 and then sell them to the Osage member that they represented for $2,500. As the wealth of the Osage grew, so did the schemes for exploiting the tribe. Hundreds of criminals were drawn to the region with schemes designed to acquire a portion of Osage wealth. Many of these new arrivals openly stated that they had come to Oklahoma âto marry an Osage squaw.âIt was a method that frequently succeeded. However, some of these opportunists sought a more direct method: murder. Author Grannâs research discovers one individual, William Hale who had arranged for the murder of 24 members of the Osage tribe. By soliciting the help of associates, Hale became one of the wealthiest men in Oklahoma. The astonishing catalogue of slaughter is carried out by men willing to resort to any means to accomplish Haleâs goal. Dozens of victims were poisoned with tainted moonshine and corrupt medical personnel performed autopsies that listed âacute alcoholismâ as the cause of death. Others were dispatched with a bullet to the back of the head or between the eyes and the victimâs body was found in his new car on a remote road. One family was killed by a dynamite blast that demolished their home. Often, Hale simply paid an assassin to kill a designated victim. Then, Hale would frequently hire a second assassin to kill the first. In those instances in which murderers were apprehended, Hale bribed juries and law officials and if all else failed, he simply paid another killer. Time and time again, government agents are assigned to investigate and in some instances, just as they uncover significant evidence, they are murdered and the evidence destroyed. One dedicated investigator called the FBI headquarters to report that he was on his way back with conclusive evidence against Hale. The next day his mutilated body is found near a railroad track. He had been murdered and thrown from the train. Another investigatorâs body was found in another state, hundreds of miles away. What is most disquieting about the crimes in Killers of the Flower Moon is the awesome extent of corruption that is revealed in the book. State and government officials, medical personnel and lawyers - all are contaminated with the vice of greed. The corruption is so pervasive, the few moral and courageous individuals seem helplessly outnumbered. However, there are two remarkable people in this gruesome tale. One is Molly Burkhart, and Osage who survived the systematic murder of her family...murders in which her husband was implicated. Molly was diagnosed as a diabetic by two doctors who poisoned her insulin injections, in an attempt to slowly kill her. Molly survived and divorced her husband. The second remarkable character is Tom White, the FBI agent that pursued Hale until he brought him to justice. Much of the credit of for this amazing piece of investigative work went to the Director of the newly-created FBI agency, Hubert Hoover who turned out to be a man dedicated to his own self-interest. Through much of the investigation conducted by Tom White, Hoover managed to take credit for Whiteâs courageous work. Jealous of any publicity directed toward agents other than himself, Hoover invariably succeeded in manipulating the factual data to his advantage. This is a remarkable work. Most noteworthy is Grannâs comprehensive account of the primitive nature of investigations in a time before forensics emerged. As a consequence, much of Tom Whiteâs heroic pursuit of a villain who seemed to have the protection of most of Oklahomaâs judges, lawyers and public officials. However, Grannâs greatest achievement is the fact that he uncovers evidence that the total number of victims in the Osage murders exceeded the original 24 and possibly exceeded over 200.",book
"There is an even deeper layer of murderous intent and execution than is covered by the book. One that involves the destruction of millions of persons of color and non-american whites. Ever since 1801, just a few years after the founding of the Terrible United States of America its Army and Marines have been abroad everywhere destroying other ppl for their money, land and commodities. Already in 1805 the US Marines were trying to wrestle power from the legitimate rulers of Libya. See ""the Battle of Derna"".American politicians and their military power have for 222 years destroyed millions of non-american whites, brown and black ""incompetents"". These full-blooded white American ""guardians"" have been subduing, robbing, impoverishing and finally destroying us, not just in their own country, but all over the planet. God Help us!",book
"American history is loaded with episodes of shame. A large percentage of our less memorable moments, as a nation, have been swept under the rug, kept out of classrooms, and largely forgotten as time progresses. But these events are real and all it takes is a skilled author to bring the lost history back to life. Such is the case with Killers of the Flower Moon.I did not know anything about these murders against the Osage until I read this book, so this was a definite eye- opener for me. I had heard of the Osage tribe, yes, but I did not know they fell into tremendous oil wealth and, subsequently, saw their members slowly dying off, either through gunfire or poisoning, as greedy individuals tried to get their hands on some easy cash. The book details several of the known killings and the cold, callous, calculated murders are chilling and puzzling. Chilling, because of the gruesomeness of the murders; puzzling, because of the nonchalant behavior of those who plotted the killings. Even when confronted with the murders, most of the guilty individuals seem to have no remorse at all. They donât even perceive what they did as immoral in any way.This book reads like a mystery thriller, however it isnât a page- turner, like some mystery genre books. You do start to make guesses as to who is responsible, but rather than get wound up in the who- done- it, the book grips you more for its educational aspects. You learn all sorts of things about the Oklahoma region that the Osage called home. You learn about the newly formed FBI and its role in solving the mystery. You learn about the problems of racism and the feelings of superiority that people felt against Indians. And you learn just how evil people can be when vast amounts of wealth are at stake.There are several surprises in this book, and one is the bookâs final section. The book leads you to believe that the mystery has been solved and it sounds like everything is coming to a close. Then suddenly, the book continues for dozens more pages as the author tries to solve more of the mystery on his own, with the aid of local Osage tribe members. No one will ever know exactly how many people were killed during this reign of terror but I like how the author took it on himself to investigate and try to answer more questions.This book is another solid, educational wakeup call on the prevalence of racism and superiority that pervaded society in the past and is rearing its ugly head once again today. I like how the book includes pictures so that you can get to know the many characters involved. With so many names and so many people involved, itâs easy to lose track of who is who. The pictures help you put a face with the name. But the most important part of this book is its educational value. Itâs another sad, shameful episode from Americaâs past and one that we all need to know about and, hopefully, learn from.",book
"If I could give âAll The Light We Cannot Seeâ more than five stars, I would. I read this amazing book on Kindle and listened to it on Audible, as well. BTW the narrator on Audible, Zach Appelman, is really excellent. His ability to pronounce the French and German names, his articulation and his pregnant pauses really added to the reading of this book.Anthony Doerrâs book is simply stunning. Dazzling is a good word for it. I have reviewed many other books and have sometimes said this or that writer writes fluidly and well. I have given five stars to quite a few writers. âAll The Light We Cannot Seeâ is a higher level of excellence that not many authors achieve. No wonder Anthony Doerr won the 2015 Pulitzer Prize for fiction with this book!The chapters are short and beautifully written. I could say âbeautifully and elegantly paintedâ; they remind me of a painting. This book is poetic, creative, imaginative and historically enlightening as well. Science and technology, itâs fascination and the power to help or harm, is explored along with the charactersâ thoughts and feelings; we learn about their courage or lack of and why they make their individual decisions during the rise of Hitler and on into World War II. The descriptions are incredibly sensitive and vivid. Objects are palpable; I could see and feel them. The book pulled me in so much that I was part of each scene. The poignant images remained with me and made the characters come alive.The author skillfully writes using a juxtaposition of events in the life of a blind French girl, Marie-Laure LeBlanc, and that of a German boy, Werner Pfennig. Towards the end of the book their lives meet.Marie-Laure, the blind French girl, lives with her father in Paris. She became blind at 6 years old due to congenital cataracts. She has developed her other senses, namely, hearing, touch and smell to compensate for her loss of sight. In her imagination, she can see colors when she uses her other senses to explore her world. Her father carves wooden replicas of all the buildings in Paris for her to learn to find her way home by herself. He is a very devoted and loving father and teaches her independence but promises her he will always be there for her and will never leave her. He is the master locksmith at the Museum of Natural History. Marie-Laure, who is a curious and bright child, goes with him to work and studies paleontology, archeology, geology and other branches of science with Dr. Gefford, while her father works.The boy, Werner, lives in an orphanage, âChildrenâs Houseâ in Zollverein, Germany. The children in the orphanage are very close to starving. A good deal of the population is very poor and not getting enough to eat. When Hitler comes to power, the economy improves dramatically. People are getting more food (meat even) and new appliances. The German population is inundated with radio propaganda. Only state supported German radio channels are allowed. The German population is brainwashed. The people think Hitler is helping them climb out of poverty, build a better society and take pride in their Country again.Yet the future looks bleak to Werner. Nazi officials tell the boys in the orphanage that they will all have to work in the coalmines when they turn 15 years of age. Wernerâs father had died in the coal mines, and Werner is not happy with the prospect of being underground in the dark pit of the mines. After finding a broken radio in the city trash, Werner gets it working. His fascination with radios and his skill in fixing them gives him a chance to escape the coal mines and go to paramilitary school. He has a chance to pursue his interest in radio technology and contribute to the new Germany. He visualizes a glorious future. In the attic at the orphanage, Werner and his sister Jutta had listened to foreign radio stations that were illegal under Nazi rule. A French radio station with science lectures fascinated them. How magical it was to hear a voice from afar, transmitted through the air! Jutta liked a program on magnets. Werner liked the program on light. âWhat do we call visible light? We call it color. But the electromagnetic spectrum runs to zero in one direction and infinity in the other, so really children, mathematically, all of light is invisible.â The radio was a symbol of freedom for them both, the freedom to learn and dream.Before he leaves for school, however, Werner smashes the radio. He does not want anything to interfere with his chance for what he thinks will be a better life. Listening to foreign radio stations is illegal and dangerous. Jutta, a free spirit with a strong moral compass, feels betrayed. She thinks her brother is turning into a cold, brutal Nazi like Hans and Herribert, two older boys in the orphanage who have joined the brown-shirted Hitler Youth. She insists that the broadcasts from the foreign radio stations say the Germans are committing atrocities, just the opposite of what they hear on the state-owned German stations.Werner gets caught up with his study of radios and blocks out the brutality around him at school. Despite his lack of courage to go against the dictates of his German superiors, the reader can see his conflict and the goodness in him that he wants to embrace. His friend, Frederick, a bird-lover and dreamer, is called the âweakestâ by the field commander but shows his courage by refusing to participate in the brutal death of a prisoner. Frederick pays for it by being beaten so badly that he becomes no more than a living vegetable.With the invasion of Paris in 1940, Marie-Laure and her father escape to Saint-Malo on the Brittany coast and find refuge with Marie-Laureâs great uncle, Etienne. Again her father observes and measures the buildings of this new city and carves a wooden replica of all 865 buildings. Unfortunately, his efforts cause suspicion, and he is arrested on his way back to Paris on an errand for the Museum of Natural History. He is convicted of âtheft and conspiracyâ and sent to a prison in Germany. Feeling abandoned but gathering her inner strength, Marie-Laure continues to live with her great uncle, Etienne, and his housekeeper Madame Manec. Madame Manec starts working for the French Resistance and Marie-Laure takes over some of her activities when the housekeeper becomes ill. Upon Madame Manecâs death from pneumonia, Etienne gets his courage up and joins the French Resistance.Werner finds himself caught up in the brutality with no way to escape. His skill in detecting enemy radio transmissions results in many deaths, some of them innocent civilians. He is haunted by the deaths, especially that of one little girl in Vienna who reminded him of his sister, Jutta. Werner is sent to Saint-Malo to find the source of the radio transmissions of the French Resistance. He finds Marie-Laureâs broadcasts, but does not expose her. He recognizes the radio programs that had inspired him so much as a child. When he hears her voice saying that someone is in her house and is going to kill her, he vows to save her if he can reach her in time. Werner finds her and saves her life. The Americans are bombing the town, but during a lull, he helps her escape Saint-Malo.Intertwined with the lives of our two main characters, Marie-Laure and Werner, fairytale and reality collide. The legend of the âSea of Flamesâ, a 133 carat diamond said to be the intended gift of the Goddess of the Earth to the God of the Sea, parallels the calamities the characters experience in their lives. It was said that the person who had the diamond would live forever, but those he loved around him would die. If the stone were returned to the sea, the curse would be lifted. Especially during the bombing of Saint-Malo, Marie-Laure and Werner both draw parallels to their own predicaments and Jules Verneâs âTwenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seaâ. Trapped in the basement of the Hotel of Bees in Saint-Malo, Werner listens to Marie-Laureâs broadcasts of the science programs and music that had been recorded by her deceased grandfather. He thinks of Captain Nemo being trapped under the sea in the Nautilus. Werner and his fellow German soldier, Volkheimer, have run out of food and water and have very little air. âWho could possibly calculate the minimum time required for us to get out? Might we not be asphyxiated before the Nautilus could surface?â Are more monsters awaiting them when they do surface?Marie-Laure is trapped in her uncle Etienneâs secret attic room where he had broadcast codes for the French Resistance. Down below is an intruder, the Nazi Sergeant Major von Rumpel. He is there to find the âSea of Flamesâ diamond, which her father hid in the wooden house replica of her great uncleâs house. Instead of giving it to the Reich for Hitlerâs dream museum in Linz, Austria, he wants to have the enchanted diamond to cure his cancerous tumor. He is dying, and he believes the diamond will save his life. Marie-Laure has not had food for two days and has had no water for one and a half days. She starts to think maybe this Nazi will spare her life if she gives him the diamond. Maybe the curse would end and her father would come back. Not trusting her safety, however, she has a knife handy. She thinks of Captain Nemo when he said to Ned Land, the Canadian harpooner, âBut let me tell you that if weâre caught, Iâm going to defend myself, even if I die doing itâ.There are many levels to this book and much to think about. The reader can get many insights into the human condition and why someone like Hitler could take over Germany and spread his sickness into so many other countries. The book is well researched and taught me a good deal about how it was to grow up in Germany when Hitler came to power. Additionally, I could understand more concretely how it was for the French when France was invaded by Hitler's armies. Good historical fiction brings all these events to life. Anthony Doerr brings a powerful humanism to the events in World War II. He made the characters come alive for me. This is a book to ponder, reread and treasure.

"Anthony Doerrâs descriptions are like no others. He molds landscapes, wars with words until my heart thumped from the vision he created for me. Theyâre unique. Iâd like to share a few of the descriptions that I enjoyed.âTo the bombardiers, the walled city on its granite headland, drawing ever closer, looks like an unholy tooth, something black and dangerous, a final abscess to be lanced away.ââThe appetite for oxygen is such that objects heavier than housecats are dragged into the flames.ââHis breath smells like crushed insects.ââAs though a weary tide stirs stones in the old womanâs lungs.âThe way he guides the readerâs vision of a place, destruction, appearance, made me wish I had a pinky size of his talent. Iâm a reader who loves and underlines phrases and sentences that stand out. That I havenât read before. Strands of words, like a string of pearls, fitted together to catapult me into another world. Who let me become friends or enemies with the characters. Some writers know how to bring me into their worlds where I get to exercise all senses and emotions.There will be spoilers in this review, so if you plan on reading the book, donât read this review. I do want to mention that Iâm not a fan of some of the classics. A reader needs patience to trudge through pages of description. Iâve tried The Count of Monte Cristo by Alexandre Dumas and Anna Karenina by Leo Tolstoy. Maybe Iâm just not that intelligent to appreciate and distinguish fine prose. Whatever the reason, this may give you an idea as to whether or not you want to continue reading.That said I feel like Doerrâs novel falls into a classics categoryâfull of description. I really wanted to love this book. Itâs safe to say I wasnât the audience he had in mind when writing it, and I'm in the minority of disliking it. As much as I adore his descriptions, I equally dislike his writing style. Itâs as if he sacrificed characters for beautiful prose. The amount of descriptions, tangents, lists, and short chapters swallow up the characters. If I canât connect with them, thereâs no way Iâm going to like the book. This book is roughly 530 pages long. It really should have been half its length.Point of ViewFirst, the book is told in third person omniscient, meaning the narrator knows all the thoughts and feelings of the characters. The narrator isnât a character nor does the narration come from a characterâs perspective. Itâs some unknown person telling me all about the thoughts and feelings of the personas. I canât recall reading a book with this POV, but I donât like it. Eleven percent into the book, my frustration got the best of me. The POV and descriptions muddled my experience. There were passages where I couldnât figure out if it was the characterâs thoughts or feelings or the narratorâs.âBlock out giant Frank Volkheimer with his mammoth boots and cinder-block jaw. Block out the little aristocratic professor pacing in front of the hearth and the late hour and the dogs and the shelves brimming with interesting things. There is only this.â When reading this passage, it sounded as if Werner was talking to himself. But he couldnât be since itâs in third person.âThe first policeman snaps flesh off his apple with his teeth. Are they looking at her?â Uh, sheâs blind. The narrator is telling me what the police are doing, and then jumps into Marie-Laureâs head. At first, I thought Marie-Laure was describing the policeman and then wondering if they were looking at her. This wouldnât work either, because if she doesnât know if theyâre looking at her, she wouldnât know what the policeman is doing.ProseThere were images in the book where I couldnât picture it. Maybe Iâm dense, but it just didnât sound right. This might seem nitpicky, however Doerr is praised for his proseâprose that took ten-years to write. Iâll share a few examples with you.ââ¦and she thinks she can smell threads of dust cascading from the ceiling.â Two issues with this description, 1) how does one smell threads of dust? And 2) how does a girl who goes blind at the age of six âthinkâ she smells threads of dust?âIn the gloaming to the east, he can make out a gray line of traffic herded between the edges of the road.â Gloaming? I had to look that up, which means twilight, dusk. Okay, itâs not his fault my vocabulary is limited, but it made me think if gloam has more power than twilight. Gloam is something I can see in a poem. Why not just say, âThe twilight in the east revealed a gray line of traffic herded between the edges of the road.â?âThe eggs taste like clouds. Like spun gold.â Huh? This is such a weird comparison. How do clouds taste, and if Iâve ever tasted them, they sure as heck wouldnât taste like eggs. Or spun gold, which I would never eat unless someone wanted to steal it from me.ListsDoerrâs writing also consists of lists throughout the book. I call the separate words or phrases placed one after the other as lists. Heâs a natural born list maker, which drove me nuts and came off as page fillers.âLight, electricity, ether. Space, time, mass. Heinrich Hertzâs Principles of Mechanics. Heissmeyers famous schools. Code breaking, rocket propulsion, all the latest.ââMarie-Laure wakes to church bells: two three four five.â He does this too much in the book that it lost its flair. âWind: immediate, bright, sweet, briny, luminous.âAlong with the lists, Doerr also counts. âShe wakes to Madame Manecâs blocky pumps climbing to the third floor the fourth the fifth.â No punctuation, and continues the counting. âHer heart beats two four six eight.â Counting doesnât build intrigue, so why have it?âStatic static static static static. In his functioning ear, in the radio, in the air.â GAH!!!TangentsThen there are tangents. Many times the narrator tells us the characters are recalling memories when Doerr should have put more time into the moment. Heâll start a chapter about a character, the character starts thinking about the past, and then the chapter ends.CharactersDoerr spent plenty of time giving me a visualization of the places, yet he fell short of showing me the characters. Also, the abundance of small chapters create long gaps between characters. For instance, Chapter 79 talks about Von Rumpleâs diagnosis, and if I'm not mistaken, the next mention of him is Chapter 92.To top it off, in regards to Marie-Laure, the narrator tells me âshe thinksâ or âshe feelsâ instead of showing me what she thought, or what she felt, and sometimes it being impossible. When talking about Marie-Laure, the author should have applied the senses using his beautiful prose. Sheâs blind, so use her touch, smell, taste to understand where she is or how she came to an assumption. Instead, Doerr uses the narrator. Below are a few Iâve chosen:âAt the top, she stands; she has the sense of a long slope-walled space pressed beneath the gable of the roof.â How does she âsenseâ this without touch? The author describes so many things indepth and then just states how she senses it. She has needed her father to make a replica of the town, which she memorized over the years, yet she can âsenseâ this area.ââ¦but Marie-Laure is certain that when they stopped to greet a woman on the way here, Madame dropped off one envelope and picked up another.â The girl is blind. Did she hear the rustling of paper? A handshake? ââ¦Marie-Laure heard the rustling of paper when they stopped to greet a woman on the way here, a slight snigger escaped their lips before they moved on.ââInsects drone: wasps, hoverlies, a passing dragonflyâEtienne has taught Marie-Laure to distinguish each by its sound.â Etienne hasnât been out of the house in about twenty-years and Marie only goes to certain places. How is it that he taught her how to distinguish between these sounds.These additional descriptions are some issues I had with other characters.âYour problem, Werner,â says Frederick, âis that you still believe you own your life.â This couldnât be farther from the truth. Werner never acted as if he owned his life. Frederick did. Frederick continued to be himself. He stood up and refused to pour cold water on a prisoner. The women in town who transferred information to one another had more guts than Werner.In the chapter, Diagnosis, the author throws in a little bit about the medical exam while the rest of the chapter is about finding jewels. Doerr has the characters reflect on other things instead of describing the moment.Thereâs a passage where Werner sneaks away to see Frederick in the infirmary. Heâs talking to a nurse, and then out of the blue comes, âEach time he blinks, he sees the men of his childhood, laid-off miners drifting through back alleys, men with hooks for fingers and vacuums for eyes; he sees Bastian standing over a smoking river, snow falling all around him.â Again, the author takes us into a reflection without really describing the moment. I also couldnât make the connection between the conversation and his thoughts of the past.The past thoughts with the short chapters and flip-flopping from one character to another, prevented me from having an emotional connection. I didnât care about them except for Frederick. When Werner died, I didnât feel sorry for him or cry, which shocked me since I cry just watching a Hallmark movie.Due to all of these issues, I gave this book a 2 star rating.",book
"""Daddy, are you crying? Why are you crying?"" That was my daughter when she came downstairs the morning I finished this book to find me sitting on the couch clutching it on my lap. I can't remember the last time I read something that affected me in this powerful a way.The spiral construction of the plot reminded me of a symphony, with stories that initially seem disparate but then you start to recognize patterns and see how the parts fit together and long before the end you are marveling at the brilliance of how the author can have conceived of it all. And just as impactful was the exquisite, poetic language and how Doerr describes the most ordinary details of life in a way that makes you realize how beautiful those things you normally don't even notice are.I think what made me cry when I finished it was something that happened near the end which I won't go into so as not to spoil it for anyone, the way characters in the story retain their decency and humanity in the midst of the horrors of war, and most of all the fact that it was over and I wouldn't be able to keep reading it any more.",book
"Being the recipient of the 2015 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, my expectations for 'All the Light we Cannot See' were extremely high. With all things considered, I feel confident in saying that the critical acclaim was warranted and deserved in this case. Despite two minor annoyances, which I cover at the end, 'All the Light we Cannot See' is a phenomenally written, percipient, and remarkable example of sound literature.Author Anthony Doerr tells the story of how 18 years old Werner, a geeky, crafty, and thoughtful engineering prodigy in Germany, meets 16 years old Marie-Laure, a sweet, astute, and affable blind French girl during the siege of Saint-Malo in 1944. WWII, with all its stentorian and fervid trappings of war is the backdrop to Werner and Marie-Laure's fateful encounter. Written in short but vividly described, intricately woven chapters, the backstory of how they are brought together is told over the course of ten years starting in 1944 and flashing back as far as 1934. Through alternating timelines from both their perspectives, they meet and thereafter, the aftermath and implications of the encounter is written about up until the year 2014.Several pages into the novel, I knew I had a special literary piece in my hands. Werner and Marie-Laure are easy to fall in love with as Doerr writes them in a way that is honest and open. They are both multi-faceted in their strengths and their vulnerabilities, without either one playing a victim. Or at least, I never saw either one as a victim. I also appreciated that foibles, frailty, and other unsavory personality traits are depicted for both, allowing them to be alive with authenticity. I never want to read about characters who are too perfect and give the sun, the moon, and the stars all of the time. In the case of this novel, the two main protagonists are realistic for their time and for the circumstances they find themselves in. Joining Werner and Marie-Laure is a dynamic, and at times unfortunate mix of supporting characters who collectively illuminate the radiance and light of when humanity is good and kind. Juxtaposed, others in the mix depict the ugly darkness of when humanity resorts to selfishness and evil. Though they are fictional, we should all be so lucky as to encounter characters like Frederick, Madame Manec, Frau Elena, and Dr. Geffard, and hope the world breeds less of Dr. Hauptmann, Bastian, and Reinhold von Rumpel.'All the Light we Cannot See' has many lessons to impart on the reader, with one of the most profound being the titular Light that we must all see. The novel soundly shows us how those who are blind in the literal sense, can see more than those who have the ability to gaze as far as their eyes will carry. Additionally, the novel allows the reader to see for themselves how people whose visions are symbolically foggy, can still find goodness of heart and lightness of mind in unlikely places, and in the unlikeliest of people. Thought-provokingly, Doerr weaves for the reader how darkness creeps and consumes those who choose to be figuratively blind and who later become disillusioned by their own rancor, malevolence, and enmity. In the heart of strong-willed characters, we see how love, patience, understanding and empathy become the key that open and illuminate the path into light.I very much enjoyed this read, and surprisingly, the short chapters were not an annoyance as can sometimes be when the author is not skilled enough to execute them. Doerr is skilled and in the case of 'All the Light we Cannot See,' he, in what was in many instances only a page and a half, or even only half a page, has written cohesive chapters that are richly dense, brimming with cerebral atmosphere that envelopes the reader at the turn of every page. In this regard, I could see Marie-Laure's loneliness, and Werner's moral conflict. I felt the fear and uncertainty in Jutta, Daniel LeBlanc, and Etienne's reticence. I could taste the saltiness in the breeze that wafted over Saint-Malo, while also I could smell the acrid, grey, and gritty skies of Zollverein. Each time a character was famished due to scant war rations, I tasted the sweetness of the cool water they drank and I could taste the crust and crumb of the loaf of bread they tore apart. These are not things easy to achieve in books. Doerr however has done so fantastically.It goes without saying that there is plenty beauty and radiance to be found in 'All the Light we Cannot See.' Some of it emanates directly from the characters, while other times, it comes from the reader's own willingness to be open-minded. Taking that into mind, there were only two minor concerns I had with the novel. First being that when the author went into descriptive details of radio repair and engineering principles, my eyes would on occasion glaze over a bit since neither subject matter are strengths of mine. Nevertheless, as a curious reader, I know that it was necessary for me and other readers to know Werner's technical acumen when the author painstakingly described the workings of transmitters, transceivers, and the intricacies of repairing electronics.The second minor concern I had with the novel was the very last chapter, which covered the year 2014. So that I don't inadvertently give spoilers, I will simply say that I would have liked this chapter better if it was written differently. I loved the significance of it and the observations made, but I would have liked it better minus the game playing grandson. Also, I would have preferred the scene take place during a final visit to Saint-Malo rather than where the scene is depicted. Even better would have been if this very last chapter had been cut altogether. Ending the novel on the previous chapter labeled ""Frederick,"" would have had a better impact in my view.Despite the minor misstep in the last chapter, 'All the Light we Cannot See' is superb all around and I absolutely recommend it. I also want to point out that unlike some readers, the back and forth narrative depicting differing timelines and differing character perspectives did NOT bother me one bit. This is a technique that I appreciate and think it is one of the reasons why this novel is so special. Readers who complain about this non-linear technique must challenge their ability (or lack of it) to retain multiple levels of story details as the plot progresses. For serious readers who like their books to have weighty, loaded implications, and for readers who appreciate intelligent writing that give literary gifts every turn of the page, 'All the Light we Cannot See' is for you. Read carefully and ""open your eyes and see what you can with them before they close forever."" 5 Stars!",book
"All The Light We Cannot See by Anthony Doerr has been discussed so many times on social media, I'm not sure I can add or say anything more that hasn't already been said. I thought the book was different and exceptional, and I can fully understand how it won a Pulitzer Prize. From the story itself, to the characters contained within, I thought it was brilliant. I know several readers did not like the constant change in time-line, but for me, it left me in suspense and turning the pages. For those who haven't read it, it's the story of a 16 year old blind girl named Marie-Laure and Werner, a young German boy and their perspectives and experiences in France during WWII. I have read a lot of wonderful fiction centering around WWII, but this book is unique in its storytelling and writing. I have to say for several days I found myself unable to begin another book. I just didn't want to let go of the characters. I can't say I was completely happy with the ending, but such is life. All I did was bend my spouse's ear for days about the book. I think he was happy when I finally moved on. To care about a book that much says a lot about the writing.",book
"Right away we meet âThe Girlâ- 16 year old Marie-Laure LeBlanc who grew up in Paris and lost her sight at the age of 6. She is the only daughter of a widowed father, Daniel LeBlanc who works at the Museum of Natural History as the locksmith prior to the German occupation of Paris. And we meet âThe Boyâ- 18 year old German Private Werner Pfennig who grew up in Zollverein, a coal mining town 300 miles northeast of Paris. We are alongside adolescent Werner and his younger sister, Jutta, when they find a crude radio which he begins to dissemble and assemble because ânothing heâs encountered before has made so much senseâ. The Reich learns of his aptitude with electronics and invites him, at 14, to attend Jungmanner, a military training camp for the best and brightest where he is instructed to â. . . eat country and breathe nation.â He is described as âthis snowy haired dreamer plucked out of the sootâ.The author uses alternating chapters to reveal the back story of each character and to bring each character eventually to the walled city of Saint-Malo. In one story, the Germans occupy Paris so Marie-Laure journeys with her father as a last resort, to stay with her great uncle Etienne in a house, Number 4 rue Vauborel, which is also richly detailed. In our parallel story, the boy, Werner is currently stationed at the Hotel of Bees, Saint-Malo, as an electronics expert monitoring the airwaves listening for planes.Present day in this novel is two months after D-Day with half of western France free from German occupation. Saint-Malo however is the last citadel for the Germans and residents fear there may be a thousand or more Germans ready to die for their cause. Four years of occupation and now, a real sense of urgency. The author describes leaflets dropped by planes to warn residents to find shelter or leave before an impending airstrike. Marie-Laure's father is being held somewhere though and she decides to wait for his return. The bombers plan to cross the channel at midnight. Those chapters describing the present, ratchet the growing concern of the citizens of Saint-Malo as the reader meets many of the neighbors and townspeople who become real citizens of action. We learn of past broadcasts from the radio tower with its ingenious cabling as we listen in on present day broadcasts- the reading of Jules Verne's â20,000 Leagues Under the Seaâ.Werner waits in the basement of Hotel Bees monitoring the radio. Marie-Laure waits for her fatherâs return in her third floor bedroom with two tin buckets filled to the brim with water and the bathtub on the floor below filled as well (in recent months there have been instances of water shortages).There is also a rare, 133 carat blue, priceless diamond, âThe Sea of Flamesâ and a perfectly scaled model of each structure and street on Saint-Malo.The NY Times review had this to say about Werner. âAs the words of his teachers fight the power of his memories, an inner voice tells him, 'Open your eyes and see what you can see with them before they close forever.â This resonates so strongly with the reader because in our parallel story, Marie-Laure navigates by touch and then by memory.Throughout the story powerful images resonate- night-time readings over the radio, John James Audubon sketches, canned peaches, barnacles, a boiling frog. How does it happen that Werner âwhen he opens his hand, there is a little iron key in his palm.â?So, who should read this book?This book is perfect for readers who love Geography. The place itself is fascinating; the reader can see in pictures of the walled city of Saint-Malo a natural isolation brought on by the tides. This was âthe brightest jewel of the emerald coast of Brittany, Franceâ prior to the German occupation and it's easy to see why they continue to hold on to it.This book is perfect for readers who love Historical fiction. The pivotal event of the story is well documented. The book provides an insider perspective to the events of the day, eyes on the ground so to speak through the observations and movements of Werner combined with those of the Whelk and the Blade. The book has been criticized for glossing over the hardships of war. Iâm not sure I agree; the wartime hardships here are intimate, personal.This book is perfect for readers who love familiar literature drawing parallels or individual observations about âTwenty Thousand Leagues Under the Seaâ and the fate of Captain Nemo.This book is also for readers who like to read aloud; some of the chapters are short like diary entries and the novel is presented in an extremely readable format.What does the title mean?The first thing that comes to my mind when I think âAll the Light We Cannot Seeâ is Marie-Laureâs inherent hope and optimism. She waits for her father, she ventures out, she takes action, she lives her life in spite of her handicap. She encourages this feeling in those close to her. For me, this light expands beyond Marie-Laure to include the good in her uncle, neighbors, friends, Werner, Jutta. We read of small and large acts of courage, of defiance, of hope.The light in the title is also a topic Werner hears discussed on a late 1930s radio broadcast about the brainâs power to create light in darkness (coal mines, blackouts, blindness). The phrase âopen your eyes and seeâ pops up in several different places in the novel. Conversely the author writes, âto shut your eyes is to guess nothing of blindnessâ.And if âlightâ is truth, there are many examples where we are confronted by lies- the letter from Marie-Laureâs father, the letter from Werner to Jutta, and where characters decide to hide the real truth or not to interpret it correctly.Notable Quotes:âOpen your eyes and see what you can with them before they close foreverâ (pages 48-49).âThere are, he assures her, no such thing as curses. There is luck, maybe, bad or good. A slight inclination of each day towards success or failure. But no curses.ââIs it right to do something only because everyone else is doing it?â, Jutta.âThere must be order. . . The entropy of a closed system never decreases. Every process must by law decay.â (page 240).âDonât you want to be alive before you die?â, Madame Manac (page 270).âOffering a loom on which to spin his dreams.â (page 389).âI wake up and live my lifeâ, Marie-Laure (page 468).",book
"(Warning: contains spoilers)Anthony Doerrâs 2014 novel All the Light We Cannot See is a story of survival, courage, sacrifice, suffering, family, friendship, love, hope, and survival. Itâs set in France and Germany during WW II.How many thousands of novels does that thumbnail description fit? (Jaded publishers and others in the business are starting to think of such novels as just another WW II book, which might account for some of the tepid reviews the novel got before it circulated through the wider reading community.)All the Light We Cannot See is one of the richest, most readable, discussable, and likeable WW II novels ever. Yes. Likeable. A narrative of war and suffering and death becomes a hopeful hymn about family, kindness, potential, magic, love, and mystery.Doerr brilliantly shows us the specifics in the general: the character so unique and real that the reader can become the character. And thus we can truly cloak ourselves in the potential for individual goodness in the storm of a world gone mad. We learn and are comforted by how we might behave in a similar situation.In the final analysis, the story belongs to Marie-Laure, the little blind girl with the father who keeps thousands of keys for the National Museum of Natural History and is a gifted woodcarver. In both Paris and Saint-Malo he carves tiny, clever models of their neighborhoods, which Marie-Laure must memorize with her fingertips. Then by counting grates, benches, streets, and tapping her other senses for cues, she must show him she can navigate their neighborhood. He also teaches her to use her cleverness to unlock tiny objects to find the treasures inside. To this reviewer, those incredible miniatures, made in such a rush by a father for his vulnerable six-year old girl as the Germans draw near, are the most unforgettable takeaways of the novel. And as her world is going up in conflagration, Marie-Laureâs fingertips race across the braille dots to open another world, the world of Twenty Thousand Leagues Beneath the Sea, which she broadcasts as the bombs fall. Marie-Laure, with her blindness, has a huge capacity for the world and human experience.Then there is Werner, a German boy, whose snowy white hair is almost as much a character marker as Marie-Laureâs blindness. He is an undersized orphan trying to look after his sister and others in the industrial area of Zollverein, Germany. Werner has a preternatural gift for mathematics and radios and, as a result, is spared going into the mines, but is scooped up into the German army where he becomes a radio operator.Marie-Laure and Werner cross paths when the Allies begin bombing the holdout of Saint-Malo in early August, 1944. During the most intense part of the circular, reiterative narrative, Werner is trapped in the basement of the Hotel of Bees because of a bomb hit. Marie-Laure is trapped not far away in the attic of her uncleâs house with the cursed jewel, The Sea of Flames, in her possession. A mad, dying Nazi stalks the downstairs desperate to get at the jewel, which he believes will save his life.Thankfully, Doerr lets a long, comforting resolution play out as we see what happens to the survivors of the bombing of Saint-Malo. We see the survivors intermittently as they go about life-after-the-war until 2014 (the novels pub date). So vicariously was I participating in this novel, if I should go to Paris this year (fat chance), I would keep an eye out for an elderly blind lady who seems to know where she is going. And I do believe some evil potential, buffeted and stained to look like ordinary sea rock, is always being swished around on the ocean floor waiting to be found and polished.Doerr expands the literal plot line (this-happens-then-this-happens-then-this-happens) with a richness of inversions, paradoxes, oxymorons, juxtapositions, repetitions, symbols, and motifs that invite the reader to go beyond the storyline. For example:â¢ Clearly, a mollusk is not just a mollusk. And whatâs with all those birds?â¢ Before two of the most heart-breaking events of the narrative (the rape and Wernerâs death), why are there quasi-Eucharistic events?â¢ Why is the fabulous diamond, The Sea of Flames, given such an oxymoronic name?â¢ How can we not see light?â¢ Why is Twenty Thousand Leagues Beneath the Sea the message of comfort to all who hear Marie-Laureâs last broadcast? (On the surface, it would seem to be an inversion of the usual message of hope.)â¢ Why can the story be read pretty effectively backwards?Doerrâs story has become an earwig. Certain images, characters, events, and themes will always remain in my head. More than any novel Iâve read in years, I felt that I was buried with Werner below the Hotel of Bees. I was in the cold orphanage attic with him when, as a boy, he listened to a faraway voice talking about the nature of light on the radio. I was as hungry as Marie-Laure contemplating opening the last unlabeled can of food in the attic.As an adult who has read a gazillion novels, Iâve largely lost my childhood ability to be carried away into another world by a story. So thank you, Anthony Doerr, for letting me do that again.",book
"I find this review a bit difficult to write because honestly, I donât know where to start! All the Light We Cannot See is like no other book that Iâve read before. On its surface, this book is about a young German boy with a talent for fixing radios and a blind French girl who possesses a curiosity and courage way beyond her years â both thrown helplessly into a world torn apart by war and devastation and the impact this has on their lives. But this book is so much more than that! It is about survival, love, courage, family, friendship, etc but on a deeper level, it is also a ""study"" on human nature and what it means to ""do what is expected"" versus ""do what is right.""The author Anthony Doerr has a masterful way with words â the richness in detail with which he describes every character / event / scene in the book paints a vivid picture of what life was like in the midst of war, yet he does so in a manner that does not take away from the story itself. He does not bog the story down with long, tedious paragraphs or pages and pages of detailed description that make readers like me want to just skip ahead to the actual story and not bother with the details. Instead, he uses brevity as a powerful tool â in just a few words, short phrases, sometimes not even complete sentences, he is able to bring to life not only his characters and the situations they encounter, but also draw the reader into their world to experience it for ourselves. As I was reading, I actually felt like I was being transported back to that time period (mid 1930s to 1940s), walking alongside the characters, seeing what they were seeing, feeling what they were feeling. The atrocities of war described in the book were very harsh and very real, despite this being a work of fiction. I actually winced during some of the parts where an atrocity was being described and had to set the book aside for a few minutes to calm myself. Iâve read other books in the past about his time period, about World War II and the atrocities of war, but none of those books had the impact this one did. Thinking about it now, I realize why: those books either use WWII merely as a backdrop without going into much detail or if they do, the events are portrayed in a way that makes it feel like a story or a recounting of history â as a reader, you are told what happened during that time period but donât really feel a connection to it. This book, in its uniqueness, actually makes you LIVE that history rather than just read about it.The other unique aspect to this book was the storyline involving the cursed stone, which brought an unexpected element of suspense that still blended in perfectly with the rest of the story. In the hands of a less capable author, incorporating this part of the story might ruin the book entirely, but with Doerr, this is definitely not the case â he is consistent with the details as well as the storytelling and incorporates this arc seamlessly throughout the book. I found myself at the edge of my seat at certain points wanting to find out what happens next -- whether the stone would be found, whether certain characters would get caught, etc. I enjoyed this part of the book immensely!My only âcomplaintâ about this book would be in its structure, as the story is told in different timeframes and switches back and forth after every couple chapters. This interrupted the flow a bit and did slow me down at times when reading, since I had to go back and re-read certain parts in order to remember where the previous timeframe left off. It also caused a little bit of confusion for me initially with some of the characters who were already part of the story when the book opens but then are introduced for the first time when things switch back to the earlier timeframe, then it picks up with what happens to that character from the later timeframe when it switches again. Not a show-stopper by any means of course, but I think the book wouldâve been easier to get through if it didnât switch back and forth. I'm pretty sure there was significance to structuring the book this way but unfortunately it was lost on me.Despite this long review that I just wrote, I actually donât feel like I did this book any justice. In fact, no review can do this book much justice because it is a book that canât just be âdescribedâ -- you basically have to read and experience it for yourself. For me personally, I loved this book and I know this is a story that will stay with me for a long time to come. I can totally see why this book won a Pulitzer Prize â absolutely well-deserved!(Read in January 2017)",book
Hoping the show is as good as the book! One of the best books I've read in years! The sympathetic views of the Germans may not be so popular but the book shows the humanity of both groups of individuals.,book
"I did not read this book, I inhaled it. If I could give it 6 stars, I would. There is a reason it won the Pulitzer. Actually, there are many.",book
"4.5 starsAmazon delivered my copy early, so I'm going to do a spoiler free review and then a spoilery one. Pardon if this winds up sounding like an English paper. I have thought so much on the morals and questions in this book that I feel like I should have read this in school.Note: I'm writing this review with the express belief that you, reader, have at least read the book description. Otherwise why are you reading this review?I want to start this off by saying two things. One, this is not a hero story. Snow is never once, in my opinion, shown to be a hero in this in what we modern folks would call a hero. He's no Luke Skywalker or redeemed villain. This isn't some sob backstory to explain ""why the bad guy is bad."" This is yet another set of layers to the onion that is Snow.Second, this book is dark. It's been a minute since I read the original trilogy, but I swear it wasn't quite as graphic as this book was. Cannibalism is mentioned, and it's shown/talked about that someone sawed the leg off a dead woman and ran off with it. One character is killed then hung on a hook and paraded. Another is also gruesomely displayed after their death. Several characters are dragged through processions to ""prove a point,"" another character is hung from two large poles and left to basically die in the sun. Multiple accounts of vomiting/poison throughout, and a general unpleasantness at the lack of regard for human life.Non-spoilery review:This book makes you think. A lot. It makes you question things, and wonder if maybe Snow is right (he's not), but it's written in such a way that he's not a villain. Donald Sutherland in an interview made a great point in saying that Snow isn't a villain, he's just a ruthless man doing what he thinks is right to keep his home and country in one piece.""He does it so well. And he doesn't think he's a bad person. He thinks it's the only way society can survive. And whether you think he's right or wrong, he doesn't think he's bad. He likes himself.""This should be the mantra for this book. Snow is a conflicting, flawed human. In our society, he's evil, a sociopath or a psychopath. He's a murderer and a killer. He's a bad guy. In his world, he's one of the masses. He simply lives as he's been raised to, with a mentality that has been ingrained in him since the war between the Districts and the Capitol. He's simply more ruthless then most and has the guts to make what he considers the ""hard decisions.""Regardless of the other characters in this, they're all props to his story--which fits well with the Snow we know from The Hunger Games. Everyone is second stage to Snow and his life. This is his evolution from being a child to a man, to becoming the Snow we know and love/hate.I definitely don't think this book is for everyone. I'm sitting here with my mom breathing down my neck because she can't wait to read it, and I don't think she'll like it at all, and she's a diehard THG trilogy fan. Why? Because not everyone likes to read depressing books. There's no redemption in this. There's no saving someone from themselves. This is the fall, stumble, plummet into being a not great person and embracing it fully.So take that as you will. Full spoilers below about everything.P.s. This is a standalone.SPOILERS BELOWOkay, so, I was worried about this book when I read the first chapter sample and it got announced that Snow would be training the District 12 girl. I thought, oh crap, it's gonna be a cliche YA. It's gonna have a stupid romance that undercuts the whole plot and makes him a sap. And yeah, it did that, and up until the last 50 pages I was teetering on a 3-3.5 stars. And then oh boy, the end.Lucy Grey was a sweet girl, but she felt off since the beginning. I still can't fully put my finger on it, but her and Snow's relationship felt so <i>wrong</i> the entirety of the book. The red flags went up repeatedly every time he made comments about how she was his, and even so far as to say she was his property, and that's all kinds of wrong. And even though their romance was cute and fluffy, it felt bad, tainted. You knew something was going to happen. It always does in these villain backstories. Usually the whole reason the villain is bad is because the love interest gets brutally killed and then they're like whelp, guess I'll just be evil.Not in this book.Snow constantly struggles with morality and right and wrong throughout this. Should he turn in his friend to the Capitol because they're colluding with rebels and could tear down the (flawed) infrastructure? Or should he turn a blind eye and let his friend do his own thing? Is the Hunger Games wrong or good? Is it wrong to view the District people as second class humans? And so on. This book broaches the topic of racism in very broad terms with the whole District/Capitol thing. You've always known there was a divide between them, but in this, you really see how much the Capitol looks down on the Districts, and you can easily see how that morphs into such a hatred and distaste by the time Katniss first enters the Hunger Games.But I digress. Snow struggles with morality, but he's flawed and very, very imperfect. He rationalizes every death he takes as self-defense or some other reason when really he's just murdered someone because it's inconvenient for him. He kills (or at least removes her from the picture; it's ambiguous) Lucy Grey in the end because she's a loose end and too free. He does it. Not someone else, not some freak accident. He chooses to do it and, by the time it happens, you already know what direction he's headed in so it's not quite another nail in the coffin. It fully feels like him tying up loose ends so he can go do whatever he wants.All the nods to THG characters and names was cool. You also had a lot of The Great Gatsby vibes in the Old Money versus New Money mentality that a lot of the Capitol had with District people who gained a fortune and bought their way into the Capitol life. They're looked down upon by the old families and viewed as trash.You saw a lot of the evolution in the Hunger Games, and you can see how it begins to change and grow into what Katniss and Peeta suffered through. You see how it begins to change from a simple punishment to a sport and a holiday, with the growing encouragement that it should be a normal and good thing.You also see a side of the Capitol you most definitely did not see in the trilogy--suffering. A lot of the book shows Snow struggling with having been a small child living through the Dark Days and the war. He was 8 when the Capitol won, and even then it was hard. You learn about the hell the Capitol lived through as they were besieged by the Districts' army and forced to ration, starvation, and cannibalism. It's a hard picture, and it's so blatantly told. Collins didn't hold back any punches in this. I never felt like what was done was for shock and awe for the reader, but it was definitely that for the story, and it made sense. Regardless of the Capitol not being at war with the Districts anymore, the tensions were still so high that it makes sense for the Capitol to overreact in their retaliation of events. So when one mentor gets killed by her tribute, they shoot the tribute and parade her body around on a hook at the mentor's funeral. It's disgusting, debasing, and shows how much the Capitol views the Districts as nothing more than rodents or livestock.Anyway, I'll stop talking. Go read it yourself. It's a hard read, a heavy read, but it was very, very enjoyable.",book
"The Ballad of Songbirds and SnakesAs most readers already know, this prequel explores Coriolanus's life when he was a teenager. The opening chapters reveal that he was also chosen to be a mentor for Lucy Gray who was from the despised district 12.But what she lacks in fighting skills she makes up for being a charismatic performer. Lucy Gray learned how to work a situation to her advantage.In the beginning the tributes did not enjoy Capitol luxuries but were kept in cages and barely fed. Itâs a stark contrast to the future hunger games when tributes were met with an extravagant welcome and dined on rich foods.The problem was that watching too much brutality turned the Capitol away from the Games. Snow's addition to the Hunger Games of costumes, interviews, and the underdog tributes made the propaganda go down easy. This should be a cautionary tale.A lot of readers are not getting the point the author is trying to make. In the opening of this book there's a quote by Hobbes:âHereby it is manifest, that during the time men live without a common Power to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called Warre; and such a warre, as is of every man, against every man.â â Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan, 1651Coriolanus's first ""lesson"" to be molded into the future oppressor was during the Hunger Games; when he was forced to go in the arena to get out Sejanus, one of the mentors, who was not supposed to be in there. While at the hospital getting stitches, the head gamekeeper, Dr. Gaul, asked if Coriolanus understood what he was supposed to learn.âWithout the threat of death, it wouldnât have been much of a lesson,â said Dr. Gaul. âWhat happened in the arena? Thatâs humanity undressed. The tributes. And you, too. How quickly civilization disappears. All your fine manners, education, family background, everything you pride yourself on, stripped away in the blink of an eye, revealing everything you actually are. A boy with a club who beats another boy to death. Thatâs mankind in its natural state.ââI think I wouldnât have beaten anyone to death if you hadnât stuck me in that arena!â he retorted.âYou can blame it on the circumstances, the environment, but you made the choices you made, no one else. Itâs a lot to take in all at once, but itâs essential that you make an effort to answer that question. Who are human beings? Because who we are determines the type of governing we need. Later on, I hope you can reflect and be honest with yourself about what you learned tonight.âA very similar thought process was also stated by the Joker in The Dark Night:âTo them, youâre just a freak, like me! They need you right now, but when they donât, theyâll cast you out, like a leper! You see, their morals, their code, itâs a bad joke. Dropped at the first sign of trouble. Theyâre only as good as the world allows them to be. Iâll show you. When the chips are down, theseâ¦ these civilized people, theyâll eat each other. See, Iâm not a monster. Iâm just ahead of the curve.âBoth the Joker and Dr. Gaul has distorted thinking. It's one thing to make a choice freely and it's quite another thing to be forced into one.Human nature is such that coercive enforcement of rules is indispensable to protect the rights of all but there is a fine line between government rule and government oppression.Later, as Coriolanus's feelings toward Lucy Gray grew, he helped her to survive the games only to get caught and was sent to train with the peacekeepers in her district. Sejanus joined him there soon after.Sejanus was never one who was comfortable with the Capital and its way of life. He got a plan to help the districts by providing the rebels with guns for their flight up north, out of Panem.Coriolanus found out about Sejanusâ plot. Mayfair threatens to tell her father [the Mayor] everything, which would implicate Coriolanus and Lucy Gray despite them being only bystanders; he shot her.Sejanus is charged with treason and hanged. And Lucy Gray Baird is the main suspect in Billy Taupe [her ex rebel boyfriend] and Mayfairâs deaths, as he left her for the mayorâs daughter.In desperation, Lucy Gray decides to join the rebels up north and Coriolanus decides to go with her, thinking there's nothing left of his life once the murder weapons were found.But as they prepare to flee district 12, Snow gets paranoid that Lucy Gray is betraying him. When they stop at a house near district 12âs lake, he discovers the rebelsâ store of the weapons. When Lucy Gray takes a long time to cut up some katniss plants, he convinces himself that she has abandoned him and went to turn him in.""What if they interrogated or even tortured her? The story would come out. She hadn't killed anyone. He had. His word against hers"".But even though Snow searches for her, Lucy Gray was nowhere to be found.The three killings that Snow did throughout the book contributed to his downward spiral and PTSD. Coriolanus clubbed to death a tribute, Bobbin, in the Hunger Games arena. He also shoots the mayor's daughter and also turns in his best friend, Sejanus, for treason, resulting in his execution.Lucy Gray was the last straw for his sanity. Back at the Capital the reader sees Snow's change to ""the dark side"".""Sometimes he would remember a moment of sweetness and almost wish things had ended differently. But it would never have worked out between them, even if heâd stayed. They were simply too different. And he didnât like love, the way it had made him feel stupid and vulnerable. If he ever married, heâd choose someone incapable of swaying his heart. Someone he hated, even, so they could never manipulate him the way Lucy Gray had. Never make him feel jealous. Or weak. Livia Cardew would be perfect. He imagined the two of them, the president and his first lady, presiding over the Hunger Games a few years from now. Heâd continue the Games, of course, when he ruled Panem. People would call him a tyrant, ironfisted and cruel. But at least he would ensure survival for survivalâs sake, giving them a chance to evolve. What else could humanity hope for? Really, it should thank him.""This happened to Ted Bundy as I believe one of the main reasons he became a serial killer was because his first love dumped him. If you were to get all his victims lined up together you would think they were all sisters and you will notice that they all look like his first girlfriend.Rejection is a powerful force in a person's life if they are not stable. Dr. Gaul planted the seeds for that rejection to take root and grow.",book
"I adored the Hunger Games series. Dystopian YA is not a normal genre for me, but this series is awesome and this prequel? A fantastic villain origin story.Coriolanus Snow is an ambitious 18-year-old student whose wealthy family barely survived the war. He is all about image and pretense, which often vie against his normal, human feelings. His parents are dead and he lives in a rundown apartment with his grandmother and cousin Tigris.But, the 10th Hunger Games is to be the first one with mentors and Coriolanus has been chosen to mentor the female tribute from District 12. While at first humiliated at not being given a more highly rated district, he quickly realizes that Lucy Gray is someone who could win and it's up to him to figure out how to help her do that. Along the way, Coriolanus learns about love and the dangers it can bring.As he works his way through the Games, he also discovers who wields the power in the Capitol, who controls the games and what he needs to do to rise up above the masses.The student mentors also have a say in how the games are run, and in a somewhat twisted sort of way, their professor gives assignments and in Coriolanus' essays, we see how future Games come about and evolve. As the mentors talk about the games and what is happening, we also see how they are not all unfeeling or unkind. They view their tributes as people and they can see how unfair the Games really are. At the same time we see that those in the Capitol are only concerned about their well being and that their losses are because of the rebels.The Hunger Games series is vibrant and colorful in its imagery. This book, however, was almost more black and gray in its imagery, what with the rubble of the arena and the Capitol still trying to rebuild from the war. That made the contrast of Lucy Gray's colorful skirt and the snakes all the more striking.As with the rest of the series, we see the government oppression, we see the results of war and rebellion. We see society broken, but fighting and we see that even with survival, life isn't grand and colorful. But we also see that the human spirit is strong.No one likes who President Snow becomes and I think writing about his story so that he gains the reader's sympathy is brilliant. The story isn't fast-paced, but it drew me in and kept me enthralled.",book
"As a YA Dystopian author, I wanted to learn from the best so I purchased this book on my birthday, just a day after I published my own dystopian book.The Hunger Games series sparked my passion for writing, so this book holds a special place in my heart. But I knew I had to let go of that bias because this is an entirely new thing. I need to read this not as a reader, but as an author. So I approached this book with a careful eye, just like any other character who approaches a jabberjay in the series.The perspective of The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes isn't new to me simply because it's from the villain's voice. It's ""new"" in a way as it explores the coming of age tale of Coriolanus Snow's cleverly paranoid overthinking mind.I knew what will happen to Coriolanus Snow, so I gripped my seat as I approved 80% in my Kindle Oasis. It was simply impossible. I don't see anything bad from happening. I asked myself, ""How will Suzanne Collins end this?""And she did.And I couldn't believe it.It was so captivating that I couldn't put it down. I will not put any spoilers here, but I just want to say... Inevitable as the sunrise, betrayals leave behind a trail of destruction for the snake. Snow will always fall.",book
"I have such mixed emotions after finishing this book, but first of all - this book is absolutely incredible. I honestly think it might be my favorite book of the HG series (!) and Ms. Collins absolutely does not disappoint with her writing and content. Getting to read about Panem, and thus the beginning of the HG was so gratifying and the way this story flowed into, and matched up with, the trilogy was absolutely flawless. Truly, it is excellent!Now - it's kind of rare to read a book when the protagonist is the villain. We all clearly know from the HG trilogy that President Snow is a pretty terrible person, yet reading this book, from his point of view, it's easy to forget that; but it's also fascinating to see how he thinks of himself and sees his own actions. Along that same thought - Snow is very charismatic and definitely knows how to work the people around him to get what he wants or to present himself in a way that will clearly benefit himself, often at the cost of someone else.~~Minor spoiler ~~The other part of Snow's life that I do find incredibly sad - while he definitely has poor character traits to begin with, he was also very manipulated by several people around him, which I think added *considerably* to how he turned out as an adult and VERY much shaped his viewpoint, and his creation of the games.So definitely worth the read (and re-read). This book is very thought-provoking, even from outside the dystopian viewpoint. There are a lot of reflections on who WE are - as humans; as groups & societies; on the roles of government and the rights of its citizens.For the many pages, it reads quickly! Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",book
OK I was skeptical on getting this book. But I have to say after reading it I absolutely love it. I always wanted to know about Snow and how he came to be the way he was in the books. This book explains it all. I am one of those that read the hunger games at least once a year. Iâm telling you right now this is going to be in the lineup. Itâll probably be the first book that I read. I love learning about his cousin and then remembering that she ended up in the hunger games as well. The names of the kids that went to school with him. iâm just saying it is a good read. It is one of those that you donât want to put it down. Enjoy the book have fun. And may the odds be ever in your favor,book
"I was skeptical about this book keeping my interest. It is a prequel, which *usually* at least gives a few kernels that make ""the original trilogy"" a deeper experience.I was wrong. Like, really wrong. Collins always delivers and this book is a testament to her talent. There are more than a few kernels to be mined here. The title itself is quite clever, as this is Lucy Gray's story, too.I can't say more, nor list any topic specifically without spoilers. I can say we watch the evolution of a Capitol-born citizen trying for a better life to the man who would become president of Panem.-ncv",book
"""The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"" by Suzanne Collins is a captivating and original addition to the Hunger Games series. This prequel takes readers on a journey to understand the origins of the Hunger Games and explores the complex character of Coriolanus Snow, who later becomes President Snow, giving him a lot more nuance than previously afforded. The story delves into the darker and more morally complex aspects of the Hunger Games world, offering a fresh perspective on the events that led to the dystopian society depicted in the original trilogy. While it may not have the same level of action and intensity as the earlier books, it compensates with its rich character development and thought-provoking themes and the lack of 'action' makes sense given the setting and novelty of the Hunger Games at that point. This novel is a must-read for fans of the Hunger Games series, as it adds depth and complexity to a world we thought we knew so well, making it an enthralling and thought-provoking experience from start to finish. Though the open-ending was a little confusing to me.",book
"If you loved the Hunger Games, you have to read this. I couldn't put it down. I loved everything about it; the characters, the storyline, and the storytelling. This book was a great addition to the Hunger Games series. I am now going to re-read the other books. This book offered insight and background for the books. I can't wait to see the movie. I am so excited!!!",book
Amazing! Another great story in the Hunger Games saga. An interesting look at how Snow progressed from scared boy into what he eventually became as President of Panem. Loved all the tie ins to the original story line and how their origin could have influenced his hatred of Katnis in the original series. Nicely written. Hoping for more in the future!!,book
"This book needs to be read by everyone; Especially in light of what is happening at the present. I read this book several years ago but see its relevance at this critical time. We have forgotten and need to be reminded, and those who are ignorant of the great atrocities that humankind did to the Jews need to be informed. May our young people read and use their critical thinking skills to understand.",book
"I liked the descriptiveness of this book. It was so personal and detailed, making it hard to put down. I recommend for adult audience, as details are strong to digest. You can feel the sadness and pain throughout the pages. I gave 5 stars for the good read and details of such a tragedy that occurred in the world.",book

"Elie Wieselâs Night: Shedding Light upon the DarknessElie Wieselâs Holocaust memoir, Night (New York, Hill and Wang, 2006, translated by Marion Wiesel), is one of the best-known and most highly acclaimed work about the Holocaust. The New York Times called the 2006 edition âa slim volume of terrifying power,â yet its power wasnât immediately appreciated. In fact, the book may have never been written had Wiesel not approached his friend, the novelist Francois Mauriac, for an introduction to the French Prime Minister Pierre Mendes-France, whom he wanted to interview. When Mauriac, a devoted Catholic, mentioned that Mendes-France was suffering like Jesus, Elie Wiesel responded, in the heat of the moment, that ten years earlier he had seen hundreds of Jewish children suffer more than Jesus did on the cross, yet nobody spoke about their suffering. Mauriac appeared moved and suggested that Wiesel himself write about it. The young man took his friendâs advice. He began writing in Yiddish an 862-page manuscript about his experiences of the Holocaust. The Central Union of Polish Jews in Argentina published in Yiddish an abbreviated version of this book, under the title And the World Remained Silent. Wiesel later translated the text into French. He called it, more simply and symbolically, Night (La Nuit), and sent it to Mauriac, who helped Wiesel find a publisher (the literary and small publishing house Les Editions de Minuit) and wrote its Preface. The English version, published in 1960 by Arthur Wang of Hill and Wang, received strong critical acclaim despite initially modest sales. Elie Wieselâs eloquent and informed interviews helped bring the difficult subject of the Holocaust to the center of public attention. By 2006, Oprah Winfrey selected Night for her high-profile book club, further augmenting its exposure.This work is definitely autobiographicalâan eloquent memoir documenting Wieselâs family sufferings during the Holocaustâyet, due to its literary qualities, the text has been also read as a novel or fictionalized autobiography. The brevity, poignant dialogue, almost lyrical descriptions of human degradation and suffering, and historical accuracy of this multifaceted work render Night one of the most powerful Holocaust narratives ever written.Elie (Eliezer) Wiesel was only 15 years old when the Nazis entered Sighet in March of 1944, a small Romanian town in Northern Transylvania which had been annexed to Hungary in 1940. At the directives of Adolf Eichmann, who took it upon himself to âcleanseâ Hungary of its Jews, the situation deteriorated very quickly for the Jewish population of Sighet and other provincial towns. Within a few months, between May and July 1944, approximately 440,000 Hungarian Jews, mostly those living outside of Budapest, were deported to Auschwitz aboard 147 trains.Wieselâs entire familyâhis father Chlomo, his mother Sarah, and his sisters Tzipora, Hilda and Beatriceâsuffered this fate. Among them, only Elie and two of his sisters, Hilda and Beatrice, managed to survive the Holocaust. However, since the women and the men were separated at Auschwitz upon arrival, Elie lost track of what happened to his sisters until they reunited after the war. In the concentration camps, father and son clung to each other. Night recounts their horrific experiences, which included starvation, forced labor, and a death march to Buchenwald. Being older and weaker, Chlomo becomes the target of punishment and humiliation: heâs beaten by SS officers and by other prisoners who want to steal his food. Weakened by starvation and fatigue, he dies after a savage beating in January 1945, sadly, only a few weeks before the Americans liberated the concentration camp. Throughout their tribulations, the son oscillates between a paternal sense of responsibility towards his increasingly debilitated father and regarding his father as a burden that might cost him his own life. Elie doesnât dare intervene when the SS officer beats Chlomo, fearing that he himself will become the next victim if he tries to help his father. In the darkness and despair of Night, the instinct of self-preservation from moment to moment counteracts a lifetime of familial love. Even when Elie discovers the death of his father in the morning, he experiences through a sense of absence: not only his fatherâs absence, as his bunk is now occupied by another inmate, but also the lack of his own human response: âI did not weep, and it pained me that I could not weep. But I was out of tears. And deep inside me, if I could have searched the recesses of my feeble conscience, I might have found something like: Free at last!...â (112)Night is offers a stark psychological account the process of human and moral degradation in inhumane conditions. Even the relatively few and fortunate survivors of the Nazi atrocities, such as Elie, became doubly victimized: the victims of everything they suffered at the hands of their oppressors and the victims of everything they witnessed others suffer and were unable or, perhaps more sadly, unwilling to help. Although Night focuses on the loss of humanity in the Nazi concentration camps, the authorâs life would become a quest for regaining it again, in far better conditions, if at least one condition is met: caring about the suffering of others. As Wiesel explains to his audience on December 10, 1986 during his acceptance speech of the Nobel Prize in Oslo, his message to his son--and his message to the world at largeâis about the empathy required to keep the Holocaust memory alive. He reminds us all, âthat I have tried to keep memory alive, that I have tried to fight those who would forget. Because if we forget, we are guilty, we are accomplices. â¦ We must take sides. Neutrality helps the oppressor, never the victim. Silence encourages the tormentor, never the tormentedâ (118).Claudia Moscovici, Holocaust Memory",book
"The risk inherent in writing about the Holocaust is that today's readers have a hard time believing it. Those of us who did not experience the horrors of living in a Nazi death camp cannot begin to understand what it was like. Battered women and severely abused children living today, trapped in circumstances they cannot escape, may come close.But most of us have no frame of reference. Nothing in our experience even remotely compares.This ""I can't believe it"" mentality was also common among non-Jewish civilians who lived in Germany during the Third Reich--when Adolf Hitler was in power (1933-1945).Even as ""night"" descended on Wiesel's little town--Sighet, Transylvania (Hungary)--the Jewish people could not believe what was happening. Moishe the Beadle was ""deported"" by the Hungarian police, crammed into a cattle car and taken to a forest in Poland to be executed with other Jews. Incredibly, Moishe escaped and returned to Sighet with his story:""The train had stopped. The Jews were ordered to get off and onto waiting trucks. The trucks headed toward a forest. There everybody was ordered to get out. They were forced to dig huge trenches. When they had finished their work, the men from the Gestapo began theirs. Without passion or haste, they shot their prisoners, who were forced to approach the trench one by one and offer their necks. . . .""Moishe's escape was a miracle. He was wounded in the leg and left for dead. In Sighet, he went from house to house, telling his story, but the people refused to listen. Even the young Elie Wiesel did not believe him.The denial continued. In Jewish families about to be transported to Auschwitz, ""the women were boiling eggs, roasting meat, preparing cakes, sewing backpacks.""Wiesel does not challenge us to comprehend the gas chamber deaths of his mother and little sister Tzipora. Instead, he writes what we can grasp: ""Tzipora was holding Mother's hand. I saw them walking farther and farther away; Mother was stroking my sister's blond hair as if to protect her. And I walked on with my father, with the men. I didn't know that this was the moment in time and the place where I was leaving my mother and Tzipora forever.""Wiesel describes with remarkable restraint a vicious beating he receives from a Kapo: I felt the sweat running down my back. ""A-7713!"" I stepped forward. ""A crate!"" he ordered. They brought a crate. ""Lie down on it! On your belly!"" I obeyed. I no longer felt anything except the lashes of the whip. ""One!. . . Two!. . ."" he was counting. He took his time between lashes. Only the first really hurt. I heard him count. ""Ten. . .eleven!. . ."" His voice was calm and reached me as through a thick wall. ""Twenty-three. . ."" Two more, I thought, half unconscious. The Kapo was waiting. ""Twenty-four. . .twenty five!"" It was over. . . . ""Listen to me, you son of a swine!"" said Idek coldly. ""So much for your curiosity. You shall receive five times more if you dare tell anyone what you saw! Understood?"" I nodded, once, ten times, endlessly. As if my head had decided to say yes for all eternity.Elie Wiesel's magnificent NIGHT bridges that enormous gulf between ""I can't believe it"" and the mind-numbing, horrific sinking in of the realization of ""Oh, dear God, this really happened."" His account is straightforward, almost matter-of-fact, with a minimum of frenzy, inordinate dwelling on flames of infernos, prolonged death throes, or metaphysical discourses about evil.He does talk about his relationship with God throughout the ordeal. And of course about his father, who was with him in Auschwitz and Buchenwald.Why did Wiesel write this book? He tells us:""There are those who tell me that I survived in order to write this text. I am not convinced. I don't know how I survived; I was weak, rather shy; I did nothing to save myself. A miracle? Certainly not. If heaven could or would perform a miracle for me, why not for others more deserving than myself? It was nothing more than chance. However, having survived, I needed to give some meaning to my survival. . . .""In retrospect I must confess that I do not know, or no longer know, what I wanted to achieve with my words. I only know that without this testimony, my life as a writer--or my life, period--would not have become what it is: that of a witness who believes he has a moral obligation to try to prevent the enemy from enjoying one last victory by allowing his crimes to be erased from human memory. . . .""I am grateful for this book and for Marion Wiesel's excellent and sensitive translation of her husband's memoir. Some great literature has come out of the Holocaust. In my opinion, Elie Wiesel's NIGHT is the best book, and certainly one of the most deeply moving among these works.Arlene Sanders",book

"NIGHT was among the first widely read accounts of a Holocaust concentration camp survivor. It was originally over eight hundred pages in Yiddish. Weisel worked with the material, re-writing and editing it, first into a two hundred forty five page version published in Argenitina, then into a one hundred seventy page version published in France. NIGHT reached its final form with its one hundred sixteen page publication in 1960 in English in the United States. Wiesel declares that every word of the work is true and he describes NIGHT as his ""testimony."" Critics tend to feel that the basis for the work is factual, but that Wiesel's long and meticulous re-write and editing has transformed what would have been simple fact into a work of art open to a variety of understandings. Whatever the case, the English-language publication was among the first widely read personal accounts of the Holocaust, and it continues to draw both readers and praise to the present day.The book is written in an unexpectedly matter of fact tone and lacks any trace of self-pity. As such it has an quality that is very difficult to define, one in which most human emotion seems to have been burned away by the experiences the writer endured. Elie Wiesel was born in 1928 in Sighet, a fairly large town first claimed by Romania and later by Hungary. Wiesel writes that he was a studious boy, deeply religious, and the son of respected people. They had heard rumors of how Jews were treated by Germans, but the war seemed very far away, and the stories were incredible to them--even when they were told by a man well known to the Jewish community. The process was fairly slow, with Jews forced to wear the Star of David, prohibited from this and that, and finally forced to live in two ""ghettos"" in the city. Then, in May 1944, the Jews of Sighet were deported to Auschwitz. Wiesel was sixteen at the time. He would spend about year in various camps before arriving at Buchenwald, where he was liberated by Allied Forces in 1945. When he saw himself in a mirror for the first time since his incarceration, he was horrified by the reflection, which seemed to be that of a living corpse.The book has an abrupt and episodic nature, but most of it focuses on Wiesel's relationship with his father Schlomo Wiesel, and how the two men successfully stayed together during their time in the camps, and how the two men less successfully attempted to care for each other. Although NIGHT is filled with horrors, the ultimate one occurs when the grinding hell of the camp system causes Wiesel to reject feeling for his father as a hinderance to his own survival. Wiesel is also prompted to question God, and whether God exists, and if so how God can accept the Nazi's systematic destruction of the Jews. As one individual cynically comments to Wiesel in NIGHT, he believes in Hitler--because Hitler has kept every promise he ever made to the Jews.There are moments of light scattered in the work--stars in the darkness--a Frenchwoman who risks herself to encourage Wiesel, a friend whose dying act is a gift of music--but for the most part NIGHT is night indeed, and there is no escape. For all its brevity, it is painful to read, difficult to grasp, and incredibly frightening in the ordinary tone in which it is told. The book is published with a preface by Wiesel, a forward by Francois Mauriac, and the text of Wiesel's 1986 speech in acceptance of the Nobel Peace Prize. Strongly recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer",book
"This moving memoir is a raw firsthand account of the horrors of the holocaust. Covering a time period of 1941-1945, Elie Wiesel first recounts his life as a young Jewish boy living in a small town in Hungary. Despite the aggression of the Nazis, Elie's family felt themselves to be relatively safe because of the distance from the other German- occupied areas and because they were sure that the war would be over before any harm could come to them. Had they been able to foresee the future, they would have taken advantage of an opportunity they had to emigrate to Palestine. But by 1944, the unthinkable happened, gradually at first. In a series of escalating indignities, Jews lost their rights to conduct business, to own jewels, and were forced to wear yellow stars while living in Ghettos. All the while, Elie's family remained hopeful that the war would be over soon. Not until the transport out of town was announced did they realize the precariousness of their situation. But even then and in the cattle cars, they could not have anticipated the sheer terror of the concentration camps and crematoria. Once they arrived in Auschwitz, Elie's memories are focused on his father and himself, because he never saw his mother or sister again after they got off the train. Elie witnessed unspeakable atrocities, such as hundreds of people forced to dig their own graves before being shot and babies being tossed alive into fires in trenches. Elie and his father were sentenced to hard labor and endured strenuous marches from camp to camp, while trying to survive on one or two rations of soup and bread a day. Eventually, Elie's father succumbed to malnutrition and dysentery. In the midst of such misery, Elie pondered why he should even care to continue living. After liberation by the Americans, Elie happened to pass by a mirror for the first time in years. He was stunned to see what he thought was a corpse staring back at him. The whole book is quite disturbing but should be required reading so that the past mistakes of singling out a section of society by race, color, or creed to be the scapegoats for all evils must not be repeated.",book
"After reading ""Night"", I realized that it is the first book I've read that was authored by a Holocaust survivor. I was so absorbed by Elie Weisel's tale of absolute misery and despair that it only took me a little over an hour to read the entire book ... and I've found myself thinking about it's contents ever since. It is also the first book I've read that actually made me feel the authors pain.The books starts with the feeling that Germany's defeat was imminent, Weisel conveys a sense of complacency in that it appeared he and his family would be spared the worse with the Red Army's rapid westward advance to Germany. Even when Germany invades Hungary in the spring of 1944, Weisel and his family appeared content to wait for the Russians. This proved to be a grave miscalculation as the Nazis begin deporting Jews from the ghetto to labor camps in Poland ... at this point, Weisel and his father are separated from his mother and younger sister. The remainder of the book is about survival based on ingenuity, fate and others' misfortunes. As he and his father trudge through the hell of Auschwitz; it isn't until later that Weisel begins to assume the fate of his sister and mother.Throughout the book, death is both random and a frequent sight, with the lines of people plodding to the chimneys that endlessly spew the ashes of thousands upon thousands ... a constant reminder of his inevitable fate. Weisel frequently contemplates his faith in God, because there is no way, he believes, that God would allow such inhumanity on such a grand scale. When the thundering artillery of the approaching Red Army are actually being felt, the Nazis crudely force the inmates of Auschwitz on a death march to Germany that only the strong could possibly survive. At this point Weisel sees and feels how the bonds of family become unglued when starvation becomes extreme and how the endless dead are unceremoniously disposed. Buchenwald is the final destination of the death march and it is there where Weisel experiences his ultimate loss and eventual liberation by the Americans.At 120 pages (including a transcript of the author's Nobel Prize speech), Weisel didn't need many words to bring forth the pain, suffering and loss he experienced and witnessed. I found myself constantly putting myself in Weisel's shoes, often wondering how he had the will, at sixteen years of age, to endure such horrific circumstances. I intended to be critical of this book in that it left me with so many questions, mainly follow-up questions, like Weisel's thoughts looking back. But, with the book still making me think several days after I read it, I accepted and appreciated ""Night"" for what it was ... a nightmare that became reality for a teenager ... a capsule of that particular moment in time, no more, no less.",book
"I previously wrote this review right after reading the book. Today, February 15th, after applying Jamesâs system for 100 days on a few tiny habits, I feel compelled to share updates with you because they have sincerely worked.I will divide the review into 5 parts. The first part is a summary of the book with short excerpts highlighted while taking notes. Next, I hope to share pieces of advice that have motivated me while building new habits. Following that, I will share how I implemented the first 3 habits throughout these months. Then, some thoughts to whom I would recommend reading the book. Last, there are 4 complementary readings.SUMMARY[Introduction] James starts by sharing personal strategies he implemented to recover from a serious accident in high school. That event forced him to improve the quality of his routine to get his life in order, coming to the conclusion that âwe all deal with setbacks, but in the long run, the quality of our lives often depends on the quality of our habits. With the same habits, you will end up with the same results. But with better habits, anything is possible.â[Section I : The Fundamentals][Chapter 1] Here we learn the power of compounding effect: changes that seem small and unimportant at any given day will compound into remarkable results if we are willing to stick with them for months and years. James explains that âbreakthrough moments are often the result of many previous actions, which build up the potential required to unleash a major change.â Comparing to habits, he shows that bamboo can barely be seen during the first couple of years while the roots grow underground before exploding for almost 100 feet into the air in a few weeks. From that perspective, we come to understand the best outcomes are generally delayed.[Chapter 2] Based on a 3-layer concentric circle behavior change modelâdivided into outcome change, process change, and identity changeâJames explains that we should pay attention to our inner identity by focusing on beliefs, assumptions, and values. âMany people begin the process of changing their habits by focusing on what they want to achieve. This leads us to outcome-based habits. The alternative is to build identity-based habits. With this approach, we start by focusing on who we wish to become.â The strongest changes, then, happen from inside out, starting from our identity, passing through the process, and ultimately changing the outcome.[Chapter 3] In this chapter we are introduced to a 4-step framework, which is composed of cue, craving, response, and reward. James calls it 'The 4 Laws of Behavior Change'. He then explains that we can think of each law as a lever that influences our behaviorâwhen the levers are in the right positions, they create good habits effortless whereas when they are in the wrong position, it is nearly impossible. Through examples, he explains that âthe cue triggers a craving, which motivates a response, which provides a reward, which satisfies the craving and, ultimately, becomes associated with the cue.â Together they create a habit loop that, when repeated many times, habits become automatic.[Section II : Make It Obvious][Chapter 4] A primer on how cues play a crucial role in predicting habit formation without consciously thinking about the outcomes. Once our habits become so common, the cues associated with them become essentially invisible because they are deeply encoded. If we want to create better habits, a good idea is to be aware of the cues. James finishes up by sharing a strategy called 'Habits Scorecard'âa simple exercise to become more aware of our behavior on a daily basis. We first write down a chronological list of our daily habits and, once we have a full list, we score each habit as an effective, ineffective, or neutral habit. Besides noticing what is actually going on, we can notice if certain behaviors help us become the type of person we wish to be.[Chapter 5] The cues that can trigger a habit come in a wide range of forms, and the 2 most common cues are time and location. When we make a specific plan for when and where we will perform a new habit, we are more likely to follow through. Stacking our habits by pairing a new habit with a current habit is a form to connect our behavior to our own advantage. An example when building a daily journaling habit would be: âafter I pour my cup of coffee each morning, I will journal for 5 minutes.â[Chapter 6] This chapter shows how our environment plays a crucial role in defining habit behaviors. âGiven that we are more dependent on vision than any other sense, it should come as no surprise that visual cues are the greatest catalyst of our behavior.â To build good habits, then, we should either make desirable cues obvious in our environment or build new habits in a new environment to avoid fighting against old ones.[Chapter 7] One of the most practical ways to break a bad habit is to reduce exposure to the cue that causes it. As James points out, âit is easier to avoid temptation than resist it.â[Section III : Make It Attractive][Chapter 8] James explains how the modern food industry has created products that are more attractive and addictive to consumers, and by doing so he shows that the more attractive an opportunity is, the more likely it is to become habit-forming. Every behavior that is highly habit-forming tends to be associated with higher levels of dopamine. It is the anticipation of a reward that motivates us to take action. âTemptation bundling is one way to make your habits more attractive. The strategy is to pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do.â[Chapter 9] âWe tend to adopt habits that are praised and approved of by our culture because we have a strong desire to fit in and belong to the tribe.â That said, it is common to pick up habits and behaviors from our parents, peers, and colleagues. There is also a tremendous internal pressure to comply with the norms of the tribe. And, finally, we try to copy the behavior of successful people because we desire success ourselves. One of the best strategies to build better habits is to join a culture where the desired behavior is the normal behavior.[Chapter 10] To avoid unnecessary and detrimental cravings, we should highlight the benefits of avoiding a bad habit by making it seem unattractive. âHabits are unattractive when we associate them with negative feelings.â[Section IV : Make It Easy][Chapter 11] âAll habits follow a similar trajectory from effortful practice to automatic behavior, a process known as automaticity. Automaticity is the ability to perform a behavior without thinking about each step, which occurs when the nonconscious mind takes over.â The key component is to pay close attention to the frequency we perform a habit, not much for how long we have been practicing it.[Chapter 12] Since every action requires a certain amount of energy, we are motivated to do what is easy. By contrast, the more energy required, the less likely it is to occur. âYou don't actually want the habit itself. What you really want is the outcome the habit delivers. The greater the obstacle, the more friction there is between you and your desired end state.â That is why we should reduce the friction associated with our habits by creating a prosperous environment to make future actions easier.[Chapter 13] There are decisive moments that deliver an outsized impact every single day. As James puts, these decisive moments are a fork in the road, sending us in the direction of a productive path or an unproductive one. To avoid procrastination, the skill of 'Showing Up' says that we should start a new habit by taking baby steps, making it as easy as possible to take action. âA new habit should not feel like a challenge. The actions that follow can be challenging, but the first 2 minutes should be easy. What you want is a gateway habit that naturally leads you down a more productive path.â He calls it the 'Two-Minute Rule', meaning that new habits should take less than 2 minutes to do in the beginning. Once the habit is established we can improve and master the finer details.[Chapter 14] In order to keep bad habits away is to make them difficult in the first place. There are 2 interesting strategies to improve our future behavior. [1] Make good choices in advance before we can fall victim to temptation in the future. James gives a personal example by sharing that whenever he is looking to cut calories he will ask the waiter to split his meal and box half of it to go before the meal is served. If, however, he waits for the meal to be served and tries to eat just half, that would never happen. [2] Make onetime actions that can automate our future habits and deliver increasing returns over time such as buying a good water filter, unsubscribing from unwanted emails, moving to a friendlier neighborhood, buying a standing desk, or setting up automatic bill pay.[Section V : Make It Satisfying][Chapter 15] We should make sure to feel immediately satisfied after performing a new habit to increase the odds that the behavior will be repeated next time. âThe human brain has evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards.â For that, we can add a little bit of immediate pleasure to the habits that pay off in the long-run.[Chapter 16] Here we learn how to measure our progress by tracking our habits. The immediate satisfaction it deliversâas mentioned earlier in Chapter 15âis one of the many benefits that standout. Besides that, James says, âwhen we get a signal that we are moving forward, we become more motivated to continue down that path.â The most basic format to track our habits is to get a calendar and mark an X each time we stick with our routine. One of the most important passages of the entire book is as follows: âIf you miss one day, try to get back into it as quickly as possible. The first mistake is never the one that ruins you. It is the spiral of repeated mistakes that follows. Missing once is an accident. Missing twice is the start of a new habit. This is a distinguishing feature between winners and losers. Anyone can have a bad performance, a bad workout, or a bad day at work. But when successful people fail, they rebound quickly.â[Chapter 17] In order to prevent bad habits and/or eliminate unhealthy behaviors, James says that we could either add an instant cost to the action or make it painful. A habit contract is also another strategy to hold our accountability: âIt is a verbal or written agreement in which you state your commitment to a particular habit and the punishment that will occur if you don't follow through. Then you find one to two people to act as your accountability partners and sign off on the contract with you.â[Section VI : Advanced Techniques][Chapter 18] We learn how to distinguish habits when genes may or may not influence our performance especially for competitive activities. âOne of the best ways to ensure your habits remain satisfying over the long-run is to pick behaviors that align with your personality and skills.â James proposes us to set some time apart to explore new activities in the beginning, before shifting our focus to exploit them thoroughly.[Chapter 19] When we find the sweet spot of our ability we tend to learn best and fastest. The âGoldilocks Ruleâ states that ""humans experience peak motivation when working on tasks that are right on the edge of their current abilities. Not too hard. Not too easy. Just right.â[Chapter 20] One downside of certain habits, James explains, is that we may stop paying attention to the little details and errors. To counterbalance that we should review and reflect on the process over time to remain conscious of our own performance. Using a simple chart to convey his message, we learn that âthe process of mastery requires that you progressively layer improvements on top of one another, each habit building upon the last until a new level of performance has been reached and a higher range of skills has been internalized.âPERSONAL THOUGHTSReading the book twice helped me take better notes and capture details. In the meantime, I thought about 3 simple strategies that could improve our adherence to new habits. Let me share these strategies here with you, and in the following section, I will describe how I managed to cultivate the first 3 new habits upon reading the bookâfollowing the system proposed by James together with these 3 strategies.[1] The first strategy is about determining a 'commitment time frame' to avoid excuses during this initial trial period. A 1-month time frame is a fair commitment, choosing to start on the first day of the month to practice it every single day for a full month. Just at the end of the period, I will take the time to reflect and evaluate the pros and cons.[2] The next one is to choose only 1 new habit each month. In doing so we become familiar with the practice intentionally while we develop a sense of purpose.[3] Last, during the first month of any new habit, I noticed that if I spend time exploring the details and the benefits, my motivation stays high. It doesn't only help us create better practices, but it is also inspiring to learn from others who have succeeded previously by adding the same habit into their lives. Podcasts, articles, videos, books, online courses, tutorials, and blog posts are all good sources.IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW HABITS[Nov 1, 2018] I had been wanting to journal on a daily basis for many years but that had never happened. Although I have carried a notebook with me for quite a while, it has never worked as a real journalâa daily routine, when we sit down and write personal thoughts, intentions, and reflections at around the same time. Instead, it has been mostly used to take notes during meetings, to write down ideas and thoughts, to express travel memories, and to doodle. Today, after 3+ months, I haven't looked back once, and still can't believe it took me that long to start this daily habit. During the first month, I read blog posts, watched videos, and even read a short and inexpensive book to foster my creativity.[Dec 1, 2018] I have been impressed by the physical capabilities we can develop through body movement. Although yoga has been a special part of my life since I was 18, I hadn't given proper attention to handstands. But now, after 2+ months practicing it every day, it is rewarding to see improvements on a weekly basis. Again, I definitely recommend watching videos and reading tutorials to find your favorite method. This is the perfect habit to stack at the end or in the middle of any physical movement practice you may enjoy.[Jan 1, 2019] By now we know the benefits of cold showersâranging from healthier skin appearance all the way to a more resilient perspective of the world. I had previously taken cold showers for 3 months in 2017, but it was a âgoalâ mindset instead of a âhabitâ mindset. After that trial I set aside and, although I have kept taking cold showers once or twice a week since then, I wished cold showers was the default mode. Now, after 1+ month, I can't see myself taking warm showers. After all, it is about intention. Again, we can learn uncountable benefits of cold showers by reading success stories. One of my inspirations was Wim Hof. It isn't comfortable in the beginning of any chosen day, but after 3-4 minutes, both my breath and thoughts calm down.Putting them together, these 3 habits don't take more than 30 minutes of my day. While I spend about 10 minutes journaling and 10 more minutes practicing handstands, I save 5 minutes taking cold showers because I won't stay any longer than necessary.RECOMMENDATION[1] First, if you have watched videos, listened to podcasts, read articles and books on habit formation and, after all that, you feel satisfied, then, please, save your money and time.[2] However, if you are like me, that even after reading a few books on building habits and having successfully added good habits to your life, feel that there is still room for improvement, this book can be a terrific addition.[3] Last, if you haven't spent much time and energy discovering a good system to build lasting habits while breaking bad ones, please, read this book.COMPLEMENTARY READINGS[1] Game Changers, by Dave Asprey, exposed me to a wealth array of ideas/habits/tools that have helped me decide which new habit to build next. The book is divided into 46 laws.[2] Essentialism, by Greg McKeown, helped me focus on less but more important tasks, giving clarity to what matters most. This is especially interesting to break bad habits.[3] The Talent Code, by Daniel Coyle, brought more motivation when learning new skills based on the assumptions that we develop new talents through deep practices, finding our ignition identity, and having the right coach to guide us genuinely. I read it many years ago, then, a few years back, I read his following book called The Little Book of Talentâwhich is perhaps even more to the point.[4] The Systems View of Life, by Fritjof Capra, enlightened my perspectives on how nature and living beings are systematically integrated. It is a profound and slightly academic book that can complement Atomic Habits especially to tie together the 4-step framework into the feedback loop system.I sincerely hope you, too, have fun while building new habits.Take care,Haical",book

"Atomic Habits was a genuinely life-changing read for me. i know that my seem extreme, but i was living a life without good habitsâ unhealthy foods, no real routines, no exercise, etc. right before starting this book i decided i was going to start a little challenge to make some life changes, and i donât think i could have done it had i not started reading Atomic Habits.i loved the writing styleâ it was educated but still very easy and interesting to read unlike many self-development books iâve come across. the methods for change were very helpful, and hearing some of the reasonings behind our thinking was impactful. some of the most impactful parts of the book were just little phrases or ways he said things that really made me look at things differently.i really canât recommend this book enough. i think James offers a fresh perspective and it really have changed my life. iâve spoken high praise of the book and have recommended it to more than one person. youâre missing out if you donât read this book RIGHT NOW. â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸",book

"I got this a little late in the game, as it has been out and in the zeitgeist for years before I broke down and got my own copy.In terms of overall condition and value of the book itself, I was very pleased. Arrived on time, great condition (like new) and no complaints. As for the content of the book; like many self improvement manuals, I think this one will give you back, exactly the amount of effort that you put into it. If you read it and don't apply the concepts, you have wasted your money. But if you are serious about self improvement, this definitely provides tools in an accessible and straightforward manner, that can be applied simply and yield results. It's a monster best seller for a reason.",book
"Atomic Habits by James Clear is one of those rare books that I immediately read twice in a row. It is filled with dozens of science-backed and actionable nuggets of wisdom. Do you want to improve any habits in your life? I heartily recommend Atomic Habits to you! We are all driven by our habits - many of which are unconscious. Below are 9 quotes and takeaways from this life-changing book:1. ""Getting 1 percent better every day counts for a lot in the long-run."" Atomic Habits explains why the little things you do every day matters. Your little habits matter. It may not seem like a big deal to skip a workout or to be kind, but it is a big deal. Imagine if you improved your habits by only 1% every day. You'd be dramatically a different person in a year. Then imagine if you let your habits decline by 1% every day. You'd be in a much worse spot in life overall a year from now. Your little habits - atomic habits - count for a lot in the long run. What little habits are you improving upon (or neglecting...) today?2. ""You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems."" This is such an important point in the book. Oftentimes we focus on goals in our life, while neglecting to focus on the systems that help us achieve goals. As an example, I had a friend who had the goal to complete a triathlon. He achieved this goal! And then he quit working out for the next year and got out of shape... He was so focused on achieving a goal that he neglected his underlying systems of being healthy. Goal achievement can actually set us back if we don't get set up sustainable systems. Get the systems right and then we'll indeed also achieve our goals. Systems > Goals.3. ""Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become. No single instance will transform your beliefs, but as the votes build up, so does the evidence of your new identity."" I love this quote from the book. Every action - every habit - you take casts a vote for the type of person you want to become. Do you want to be a more organized person? When you develop habits and systems that organize your life, you are casting votes for thinking of yourself as an organized person. You think to yourself, ""hey, I'm an organized person."" And then you reinforce that belief with your habits and actions - a virtuous cycle! The flip side of this can be true too. What if you often show up late to meetings? You're casting votes that may make you think ""well, I'm just a person that is always late."" An un-virtuous cycle. Be careful to make sure that your habits and ultimately your beliefs cast votes for the type of person you want to become and, indeed, who you truly are.4. ""How long does it actually take to form a new habit? You just need to get your reps in."" Atomic Habits answers the question of ""how much time does it take to form a new habit"" with a better answer of : X number of actions. Meaning, you may need to simply complete a new habit 100 times for it to stick, which could be done in 3 days or 3 weeks or 3 months, depending on the new habit. It is better to think of forming new habits in terms of consistently taking action, versus trying to stick to a habit for just X number of days. Get your reps in.5. ""Reduce friction. Decrease the number of steps between you and your good habits."" The inverse of this is also true - increase friction between you and your bad habits! I think about this a lot when it comes to eating healthy. I need to reduce friction by having healthy food in the house and healthy snacks at work. And I need to increase friction by not having candy in the house or in my office! Out of sight, out of mind. In sight, and I eat it. :) (which of course reminds me of the Dad joke I often tell my girls: ""I'm on a seafood diet. I see food and I eat it...)6. ""Use temptation bundling. Pair an action you want to do with an action you need to do."" This is a powerful concept. I put this in practice by only ""watching TV"" when I'm on the treadmill. I am able to run at a 6 MPH pace and watch TV or videos on the iPad when I'm on a treadmill. So, I generally only watch sporting events or movies or 80s music videos on YouTube when I'm running on the treadmill. This approach actually allows me to run longer if I want to watch a full half of a game, for example. And 80s music videos will often give me the energy to run that extra mile. :) Think about a new habit you want to start and how you can bundle it with an action you're already taking. Stack them together - i.e. habit stacking.7. ""Use a habit tracker. Keep track of your habit streak and 'don't break the chain.'"" Atomic Habits does a nice job of explaining the importance of tracking your habits for success. What gets measured gets managed. One of my favorite habit trackers is a FitBit/Apple Watch, which tracks steps, heart rate, sleep, weight and can even track food intake/calories, if you input this data. My behavior definitely changes thanks to these habit trackers. Atomic Habits gives you additional habit tracker resources.8. ""Never miss twice. When you forget to do a habit, make sure you get back on track immediately."" We all will have days where we fall off the bandwagon and our habits go in reverse. Well, that's okay for one day. Don't let it happen twice. Get back on track as soon as possible. (And, yes, sometimes we miss a habit two days in row. Just don't let it become three days...)9. Author James Clear gets to the point quickly in Atomic Habits and with actionable advice. James has been blogging about habits, health, happiness, creativity and productivity since 2012. Check out a sampling of his writing at his website. James is also fun to follow on Twitter. Atomic Habits has 20 relatively short chapters that open with compelling stories and end with helpful chapter summaries. If you listen to books on Audible, I highly recommend the audio book as James reads this book very passionately.",book
"I've read a lot of books on changing behavior and building habits and James Clear's Atomic Habits is my new favorite. This book is different from others in the way it covers an enormous amount of ground in the larger area of self-improvement while seamlessly tying all these ideas back into the central theme of habits.One of the core concepts in Atomic Habits is to focus on the small improvement. The impact a 1% improvement per day can make may appear negligible at first, but Clear makes a compelling argument that in the case of habits, thinking small produces the biggest results over time. ""Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement,"" explains Clear.Over the months and years, the accumulated effect of small habitual daily behaviors is staggering. Early in the book we are also warned that this compounding works both ways, so we'd better make sure we're making it work in the positive direction, not for the negative.This is a concept I was introduced to years ago under a different name - Kaizen - the Japanese term for continuous incremental improvement. What's different and new in this book is how the concept is applied specifically to building habits.I found the information introduced in chapter two about behavior change at the identity level to be spot-on. You're also given a simple two-step process for changing your identity and this one idea alone is incredibly powerful.In chapter three, we are introduced to the habit loop - cue, craving, response, reward - and we learn how to build good habits in 4 simple steps and break bad habits in 4 simple steps.One of those steps to habit formation, which goes hand in hand with the 1% concept, is how to make it not only small, but easy. In the chapters that follow, this is exactly what you find out.Other ideas of great value that stood out included, habit stacking (the best way to form a new habit), habit tracking, habit shaping and how to design your environment - physical and social - for habit building success. You learn the truth about self-control, how to stop procrastinating and how to use implementation intentions, temptation bundling and motivational rituals. The book is simply packed with actionable ideas, tactics and strategies.Virtually every idea in the book is useful and resonated with me. While I may not agree that we should ""forget about goals,"" I agree with one of Clear's core principles in the book - that we must develop systems for change. If we only focus on goals and don't develop systems and a focus on the process, we risk falling into a number of goal-related traps which ultimately lead to stagnation. With the right systems, we're rewarded with continuous improvement on a lifelong journey of success.Another difference between Atomic Habits and other books in this genre is that while it's based on science it doesn't bog you down with unnecessary details of the research. Clear's book is intensely practical, giving you a huge toolkit of organized and named strategies you can apply immediately to create and strengthen positive habits and stop the negative ones.The book is conversational, and includes many interesting stories, making it easy to read - and hard to put down (I read it cover to cover in one day).It's possible this might become your most highlighted personal improvement book because every page is so chocked full of memorable and quotable gems of advice.",book
"I began reading this book with very high expectations and it did not disappoint. I, myself, am a big believer of the power of habits and have done a lot of research on the topic. Yet I learned a lot, especially the clarity with which the author presents his ideas. Big parts of the book were, in some sense, confirmation that I was doing things the right way, since I was oftentimes thinking ""oh yeah, that's similar to what I'm doing"". Still, parts of the book and strategies proposed were new to me and really helped add habit strategies to my toolbox. As mentioned though, the best thing about this book is the clarity with which the ideas are presented and the way they blend together.This quote from the last chapter summarizes the ""Four Laws of Behavior Change"" (that the book is about) well: "" (1) Sometimes a habit will be hard to remember and you'll need to make it obvious. (2) Other times you won't feel like starting and you'll need to make it attractive. (3) In many cases, you may find that a habit will be too difficult and you'll need to make it easy. (4) And sometimes, you won't feel like sticking with it and you'll need to make it satisfying.""Here's some of the notes I made while reading the book:- Habits are like compound interest in self-improvement.- Outcomes are a lagging measure of habits.- The ""Valley of Disappointment"" is the period where you are putting in the hard work but still seeing no results. --> but remember, your work is not being wasted, it is being stored.- You do not rise to the level of your goals, you fall to the level of your systems.- Your habits shape your identity and your identity shapes your habit. It's a feedback loop. (reverse causation for the nerds here)- Make clear plans - Use the ""Implementation Intention"": When X happens, then I will do Y OR if Z happens, then I will do W.- Use ""Habit Stacking"": After behavior X, I will immediately perform behavior Y OR If Z happens, I will immediately perform behavior W. (i.e. As soon as I begin boiling water for tea, I will do 10 burpees). Also, be very clear. (i.e. I will do the burpees next to the fridge in the kitchen, or whatever, you get the idea. As long as it works, it's good!)- People with high self-control are the ones who structure their environments in such a way to minimize exposure to tempting situations.- Use ""Temptation Bundling"" + ""Habit Stacking"": After X, i will Y. Right after Y, I will immediately Z,where X - habit I already do, Y - habit I need to do, Z - habit I want to do. (The anticipation of a reward is what gives us the most motivation - and not the reward itself.)- Do something you enjoy before a difficult habit.- Planning can sometimes be a form of procrastination because it can make you feel like you are making progress (while you are not).- Make your habits as easy as possible to start (i.e. do one set of abs, read one page of my book) - This is called a ""Gateway Habit"". and it helps to reinforce your identity of who you are which will itself help motivate you to keep going.- Prime your environment for future use - ""resetting your environment"" (i.e. Take out your coffee and mug the night before, make your bed perfectly, to remove the sense of sleep / bedroom if you'll be working from your bedroom)- Use pre-commitment devices to make it harder/ impossible to deviate from good habits.- Even one minute of a bad habit (i.e. checking instagram) can manifest into a lot (i.e. getting lost in time browsing instagram).- Put some immediate reward into good habits / immediate punishment to bad habits.- Create a habit tracker / calendar to provide a sense of accomplishment and motivation.- Rule: Never miss a habit twice! (life gets in the way, but don't let it derail you off your path)- Finding what you are naturally gifted in will make good habits easier. To do that ask the following questions. (1) What feels like fun to me but work to others? (2) What makes me lose track of time? (3) Where do I get greater returns than the average person? (4) What comes naturally to me?- You can also win by being different, by rewriting the rules (i.e. by combining your unique set of skills)- Periodic reflection and review can enable the long-term improvement of all habits - identity building.Finally, some quotes I liked:- ""Really successful people feel the same lack of motivation as everyone else. The difference is that they find a way to show up despite the feelings of boredom.""- ""The greatest threat to success is not failure, but boredom.""- ""You have to fall in love with boredom.""- ""Improvement is not just about learning habits, it's also about fine-tuning them.""- ""Success is not a goal to reach or a finish line to cross. It is a system to improve, an endless process to refine.""And my favorite:- ""It is remarkable what you can build if you just don't stop.""",book
"Atomic Habits, the brainchild of James Clear, is a powerful self-help book that promises to unlock your hidden potential and pave the way for transformative habits. If you're someone who, like me, could do with a few less ""gym, fitness, weights, and sports"" references, fear not â this book still has plenty of gems to offer.James Clear's writing style is undeniably unique, sprinkled with a dash of humor and a sprinkle of humility, but perhaps a touch too many ""humble"" brags for my taste. However, I'll give credit where it's due: this candor and authenticity may very well be a reflection of the book's original target audience and the author's personality.What sets Atomic Habits apart is the in-depth research that backs up every piece of advice. Clear has done his homework, and it shows. The book is a treasure trove of scientific evidence, making it hard to dismiss the ideas he presents. From understanding the habit loop to the power of tiny changes, every concept is backed by solid data, which makes the book both convincing and compelling.The real strength of Atomic Habits lies in its clear directives. Unlike other self-help books that leave you scratching your head, this one provides actionable steps that are simple to understand and implement. Clear's practical approach ensures that you won't be left wondering how to put these ideas into practice.What impressed me the most was the plethora of real-life examples scattered throughout the book. These stories of ordinary people achieving extraordinary results are inspiring and make the principles feel achievable. From the success of Olympic champions to the stories of regular folks, every anecdote brings the concepts to life.While the fitness-heavy focus might not resonate with everyone, it's essential to acknowledge that it remains true to the author's vision and persona. For fitness enthusiasts, this book will be a home run.In conclusion, Atomic Habits offers a refreshing take on cultivating life-changing habits. James Clear's wit and candor might not be for everyone, but the book's well-researched content, practical advice, and relatable examples make it a compelling read for anyone looking to improve themselves and their lives. Embrace your quirks, dive into the research, and get ready to unleash your atomic potential!",book

"The 48 Laws Of Power. Not sure where to really begin, but for people that say it is an ""evil"" book, you are taking it the wrong way. It is a powerful, self defense book NEEDED, because it literally teaches you how to deal with people out there in the world that are negative, toxic, liars, flatterers, fake, angry, suspicious, murderers and many more. To go into in depth detail of the book, here is how it is mainly summed up.You come across a Law. It says what it is. You then read a Transgression or Observance of the Law. Which these are real, historical stories that you will be reading. Some of these stories are cruel, fascinating, and overall jaw dropping. You'll find some of the worlds most recognized leaders and influencers in these stories.After you read these stories or the story, the Author gives you an Interpretation. Which is basically the breakdown or meaning of what the law was taking place in the story. After reading the interpretation once, I highly recommend going back to read the story again. This way, you'll gain an even more deeper understanding of the law.Lastly, the Author leaves you with an image, an authority (which this is a quote by someone) and a reversal. The reversal is basically the conclusion and tells you why you should follow the law.After you read a law, have a highlighter with you and go back to highlight some of the most important words or quotes. Trust me, A LOT of things will really stick out to you. Really reflect on your own past, personal experiences or situations you've been in with others. You want to do this, because it'll help make you stronger, wiser and more prepared than ever before when you come across any situation or person in the future, because YOU WILL. WE ALL WILL. And I strongly feel that this is why Robert Greene wrote The 48 Laws Of Power. Not just so you can be powerful or controlling over everyone, but mainly how you gain or use power against those who are very dangerous and want to purposely put you down into the ground.This book is NOT a toy. And don't just think that after you are done with the book, you can immediately just go out and start practicing all the 48 Laws. That is not how it works. It is your responsibility to know what situation you are in and to know what Law will be your bodyguard. Nevertheless, you should always be extremely careful of your own actions and the words that you are going to say. Power should never be underestimated. You must learn to handle it with care. If not handled carefully, its like letting loose a tiger out of its cage and its killing everyone in sight.Read at your own risk, but most importantly, LEARN....",book
"there seems to be a lot of love and hate surrounding this book, so if you are curious but unsure, this review should help you decide whether or not to buy the book, and how it will impact youFirst, to understand the 48 laws of power, you must know two key ideas1. you CAN NOT escape the power game. thinking you can ""not participate"" is as foolish as thinking that you could somehow escape gravity or make the sun stand still. Robert Greene explains why in the intro with some excellent examples2. the 48 laws of power are neither good nor evil; they are just LAWS. If someone pushed a man off a cliff would you blame gravity for for his demise? This is the mindset you must adopt in order to learn a lot from this book.Things I Liked- NEW PARADIGMafter reading the 48 laws, you will never see the world the same way again. once you understand some of these laws you will see many underlying currents and motives you did not see before.- INCREASES POWERone of the main reasons to buy the book. you wil become exponentially more powerfull by knowing and understanding these laws-CRYSTAL CLEARevery law is clearly outlined with ""transgression"" of the law, ""observance"" of the law, keys to power, and a ""reversal""-GREAT STORIESthe 48 laws are packed with mindblowing and sometimes humorous stories of people in history practicing these laws. this is helpful as some of the concepts are quite abstract.What I didn't like-RISKYan old proverb says "" A man who plays with snakes will eventually be bitten"". If you begin to use the 48 Laws improperly, you could get yourself in some dangerous situations, lose friends, piss off a lot a people, and destroy relationships- REQUIRES DISCERNMENTif you you are looking for a highly concrete book that the says ""do xyz and you will accomplish vyx"" look elsewhere. the Laws require good judgement and and and prospecting nature to practice and apply-NOT FOR EVERYONE If you are aghast at the idea of manipulation and deceit then read with caution.OVERALL: If you want to have more power or a better understanding of why different situations turn out the the way they do, you should definitely read the 48 laws of power by Robert Greene. If you want to be naive, easily manipulated, weak, you should ignore this book and go watch some netfilx.Thanks for reading",book
"I've heard about this book here and there but I haven't gotten around to check it out until 3 months ago. I was most intrigued when I heard that this book is/was allegedly banned in prisons due to its very powerful insights and tactics. So I pulled the trigger and purchased the book.With that being said, I think this is an essential read for every adult. Was it a pleasant read? Not necessarily. It explores the dark aspects of our human nature and how power is at play in every social interaction. A lot of the laws in this book didn't sit right with my personal values and it even made me uncomfortable at some points, but that is not the point of this book. Because it equips you with the knowledge to protect yourself from subtle manipulations, jealousy, greed and other dangerous influences of those who surround you.Highly recommend.",book
"If you want a step-by-step guide to everything that is wrong with your fellow human beings, this is it. The book treats all of life as adversarial, as in, for me to win, you must lose. The fact that it is successful tells the whole story: why there is such disparity between the haves and have-nots, why we treat planet as a bottomless toilet, and why religion, an obvious fraud, has such a hold on humanity. If you want to sacrifice your well-being and relationships on the alter of getting ahead, this is the book for you!",book
"The 48 Laws of Power is a thought-provoking and insight book that delves into dynamics of power and how it can be effectively wielded. Each law is presented with historical examples and anecdote, making it an engaging read, However, it is important to approach this book with caution, as some of the tactics described may seen as manipulative oe unethical. Overall The 48 Law of Power offers valuable lessons on human behavior and power dynamics, but it is up to the reader to decide how to apply them ethically in their own lives.",book
"I read all the laws and some of them don't really make immediate sense, so it gives you a lot of historical and some more contemporary examples to help demystify some of the less straight forward ones. It's pretty easy to read, and not really what I would refer to as complicated language, more of probably early university level writing. I wouldn't necessarily agree with all of the laws, but some make a lot of sense.",book
"Reading this book has truly been a game-changer for me. Before diving into its pages, I felt like my life was out of control, with challenges and setbacks lurking around every corner. However, this book has inspired me to take a new approach to life - to view my obstacles and enemies not as barriers, but as opportunities for growth and success.One of the most impactful takeaways for me was learning how to harness the power of my enemies. The author teaches us that having enemies isn't necessarily a bad thing - in fact, it can be quite beneficial. Our enemies can challenge us to be better, to work harder, and to reach higher. They can inspire us to be our best selves, even when we feel like giving up.Through real-life examples and powerful storytelling, this book illustrates the ways in which we can turn our enemies into allies. It provides practical tips and strategies for identifying and managing our enemies, as well as shifting our mindset to view them in a positive light.Overall, I would highly recommend this book to anyone looking to take control of their life and conquer their challenges. It's a powerful and inspiring read that will leave you feeling motivated, empowered, and ready to tackle anything that comes your way. Thank you to the author for sharing such an impactful message with the world.",book

"Back in school, I absolutely hated reading. They provided 0 value to me and books were mostly fiction.This book was recommended to me by my sales coach. He said ""it was banned in prisons""...I got curious.I haven't even finished it yet. I'm about to start the 4th law.This book is straight up gold. Every single page, there is something I didn't know. Most books have 3-5 pages of information to take away. Every page I have read thus far is incredibly eye-opening.I use the first 4 laws in my day-to-day life right now; I'm sure I'll be using more as I continue reading it.I'm using these laws for good.

"Much has been said about Bonnie Garmus's Lessons in Chemistry. So when my sister chose it for our book club, I was curious, albeit cautiously.Elizabeth Zott is a brilliant and beautiful chemist in mid-century California. She seems to have everything going for her, but ""seems"" is the operative word. Because the men she works with are awful. What's more, Elizabeth isn't like other women, or even people. Unflinchingly driven and uncompromising, she refuses to perform for anyone, to smile on demand or at all. She tells the truth, even when it's ugly -- and it often is --making her seem uncooperative, unlikeable, and cold to everyone but Nobel Prize-nominated fellow odd duck Calvin Evans. Yet at her core, Elizabeth is purely kind. Despite having suffered loss, violence, and the most egregious sexual discrimination imaginable, she believes that everyone deserves to be treated fairly. And it is this humanity that she brings to her cooking show, Supper at Six.Now, if you're wondering how a no-nonsense chemist became a TV star, then I'm right there with you. Suffice it to say that unjust events in Elizabeth's life resulted in this most unlikely of developments. And although she's less than thrilled to be working with bowls instead of beakers, she makes the show her own, taking every opportunity to educate her female audience about not just cooking but chemistry and, ultimately, change. Subversive and surprisingly entertaining, Supper at Six is a syndicated smash. To me, this is where Elizabeth blossoms, her paradoxically off-putting personality, passion for science and food, and insatiable hunger for justice commingling to enable her to connect with other women. It's exciting and inspiring and all of the things. But this is still Lessons in Chemistry, not an uplifting romp about a reluctant but charismatic performer. Because as I said in the beginning, Elizabeth Zott does not perform.There's trouble brewing at the TV station, just as there was at the lab, only worse. So some things happen, and then some more things, culminating in an ending that feels like a drop off a cliff. And although I can see how it would be satisfying for most, to me it's anticlimactic. Still, this isn't my story; it's Elizabeth Zott's. She's a scientist first and in the end, she gets what she wants and needs.Maybe understanding -- and respecting -- that is a lesson that this very unscientific but very feminist reader needed to learn.",book
"Oh, my God!! I LOVE THIS BOOK SO, SO, SO MUCH!! ð 5 stars â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸, DEFINITELY ðð»!! I donât care what other reviewers say; I LOVE THIS BOOK!! I read it for my book ð club & Iâm SO glad I did!! I mean, yes, I agree with what some reviewers say: it IS, sadly, a fantasy. The sad truth is that Elizabeth Zott, the FMC, would probably NOT have even been ALLOWED to work in a scientific lab ð§ª in the 50âs, let alone be on T.V. talking ABOUT chemistry â¦ & yes, it wasnât as laugh-out-loud as I thought it was gonna be, particularly at the beginning with the r*pe scene & the sexism throughout the book that made me (as a woman in my 30âs now) VERY angry â¦ And yes, I DO think it SHOULD have trigger warnings because of this â¦ And it didnât have as much romance as the AppleTV trailer made it seems (yes, I watched the trailer BEFORE reading the book, sue me; BUT I DIDNâT see the actual show yet!) â¦ But it DID make me âlaugh-out-loudâ in the middle & had me smiling widely by the end of it!! ð It also has a very nice twist at the end! ð (Iâm not gonna tell you what the twist was because that would be a MAJOR spoiler! ð) But anyway, now Iâm very much looking forward to seeing the AppleTV show & comparing it with the book!! ð I would 1,000% recommend!! ððð»â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸",book
"Whatever you do if you are thinking of watching the television series, do yourself a favor and read the book first!This is a marvelously written accounting of the stereotypical men's world women had to endure in the 50's and 60s' . The content is brilliantly presented so that even someone who knows nothing about chemistry can easily follow along and become enamored by the science, and the explanations that inspire you to learn more and wish there were women like Elizabeth around when you were learning these topics. Be aware the story does have it's dark sides and there are some triggering scenes early on. The writing is presented well enough that you know what's coming so you can prepare yourself for the content. The television series hads taken some liberties, so if you want to know the magnitude of devotion and who Elizabeth and Calvin truly are ,READ the BOOK First! Overall I loved it and can't wait for what I hope will be future installments.",book
"I read this book when it first came out and liked it. Knowing that a show based on the book was going to be streaming, I re-read the book today in one long sitting. I literally couldnât put it down. Ms Garmus is eloquent in illustrating how male dominant society is and how women have been marginalized. This was especially so in the 1960s and 1970s, the time frame for the story. Elizabeth Zott, the protagonist in the story, is a brilliant chemist whoâd unfairly been kicked out of graduate school, had her scientific work stolen and plagiarized, then fired from the research institute where sheâd worked a a lab technicianâthe institute wouldnât deem to allow her to function as a research chemist. She became a lover with a scientist at the institute who was killed in an accident before their daughter was born. But she persevered; hence the chemistry lessons disguised as a tv cooking program. I just finished my 2nd reading.",book
"Boy. In someways, Iâm really angry that I read some of the reviews for this book. Some were ranting anbiut how negative it was about men. Some screaming feminist BS. Neither of those is true by the way I But then I was talking to someone when I was getting my haircut who was talking about this book and how much she enjoyed it and why and I thought what the heck Iâll try it. I listen to the book on Audible by the way. Fabulous.This is really unlike anything Iâve read in the last 10 or 20 years. I loved this book. I loved everything about it. I loved all the characters, men and women, and especially the dog. It was such a joy to read and I really hope that the author can come up with another book, even half as good as this one is. I have recommended this book to anyone who would listen for five minutes and bought one and sent it to my son. If you only read one book this year, let this be the one.",book
"I purchased this science period book yesterday, which is not normally in my reading alerts due to a YouTube video on the up coming show. By the first chapter I could not put it down!! Because never judge a book by its cover for one, but two the resilience of Elizabeth.This wonderful work shows that what many should know, women are capable of ANYTHING!!! Especially in the 1950s.Elizabeth Zolt is someone many can relate to, not only for her love of science but for the question ""When will someone take me seriously?"" This wonderful work will leave you on the edge of what happens next? I'm not going to give anything other away other than what I've already wrote. I just wish there was a second book to go with this, because wowwwww!!!!! I love this book.",book
"So often when you finally get around to reading a best seller that topped all the lists for almost a year, you can't quite say what it lacked but it just doesn't live up to all the accolades. This was definitely not one of those times. Bonnie Garcia has written a book full of people you Cate about grappling with the most interesting issues. There are a few villains to be sure the issues are right at the forefront of the story. Elizabeth Zott and Calvin Evans - to say nothing of Mad, Harriet, Walter, Wallet and MS Franz will stay with you long after you leave them behind the cover of this well thought out novel.",book
"Once I started reading this book, I couldnât put it down. This story tackles some big issues of the early 1960s in a male dominated workforce - sexism, sexual abuse, and operating outside âthe normâ. Two social outcasts meet and a strong bond develops between them. But they have to face the judgment and abuse of society.I loved the characters in this book. They were well developed and full of unique personalities. This group of misfits captured my heart - an obsessed and brilliant scientist, an unwed mother, an unhappy housewife, a precocious child, a minister with an open mind, a struggling single dad, and an amazing dog.Through everything, the story reminds us of the bonds we form and that we never know what someone is or has gone through. This book could have been such a downer, but thanks to the characters, it was full of humor and hope. This is a must-read!",book
"::::insert hyperbole here:::: This book deserves every single gushing review thatâs accumulated. I loved it. As a 61 year old mother, I was a child on the tail end of the dying throes of the conformist 50âs and I remember what it was even as late as the 70âs. To challenge the status quo was like belching. Everyone did it but it was never done in polite company. This book takes the reader through the fight, and fighting is painful.This book enraged me, frustrated me, made me laugh out loud in many places, especially when Harriet first enters the story, and it made me tear up in painful sorrow, in sympathy, and finally in happiness. And it accomplished all this without angst.Get this book. Itâs worth every penny and you owe it to yourself to know that the events described in this book were fairly common back in the day. Make your daughters read this and make your sons learn this.",book
"This book captured me from the first sentence. Extraordinary character development with a refreshingly different story line. The main characterâs singularly-scientific focus came across almost as Aspergerâs sometimes, which contributed even more to the story line. While I did not like her Atheistic viewpoint and criticism of God, faith, and religion (I am a Christian), I compartmentalized it as a typical character trait for someone with a highly scientific mind. I did not take it personally as some reviewers of this book have done. After all â itâs fiction! I highly recommend it. A great read!",book
"Just a couple of weeks ago, I found out by chance that John Grisham had written a sequel to his first massive best seller, The Firm. I have read many of his books, with The Firm being my favorite. I just re-read it last year in fact. So becoming reacquainted with Mitch and Abbey McDeere again in The Exchange was incredibly unexpected and exciting.I used to be a huge Grisham fan and have read many of his books. But then I began to find his books had become stale and somewhat formulaic so I had stopped reading them. But in the last few years I did read one of his more recent ones (which was ok â¦ not brilliant but ok), and I reread my two favorites of his (The Pelican Brief and The Firm). So, I was really pleasantly surprised that The Exchange was out.While I was cautious that it might be a letdown, it was absolutely not that. I was thoroughly engrossed in the story, much like I was with many of Grishamâs earlier books. He knows how to write a page-turner like no other writer I know. This book gets to a point where itâs hard to put down leaving the reader almost breathless while reaching the height of the story â something he has done brilliantly time and again throughout his career. But this isnât just a walk down the memory lane of the Grisham-of-old. He has updated the McDeeres into their early 40s (in 2006 so alas I am sure he is planning a third installment). So the McDeeres are not fresh young adults any longer. But John Grisham is not a fresh young writer any longer either. Instead he has matured his writing-style to make his legal thriller style even better.I am now a reinvigorated, eager fan of John Grisham again. It feels like I have reconciled with an old friend after a long absence. Good to see you again, friend. Welcome back!",book
"The plot is set in the past, around 2006, otherwise the McDeeres would be pushing 60. (The Firm was first published in 1991). The idea of the sequel works well - throughout the book I was picturing a youthful Tom Cruise dashing around the world with Jeanne Tripplehorn, the supportive wife, holding down the fort at home. Could not really get the images out of my head. A sequel is a great marketing idea also because all of us who enjoyed the first book avidly buy the second. Thankfully it built on the past rather than continually rehashing The Firm. The book is pretty good. It does take a while to get going and does not start out as a page turner - the chapter endings are not cliff hangers, but by midway I was hooked and reading voraciously. Sign me up for the threequel.",book
"I didn't really like this book, but for very selfish reasons that don't warrant a lower rating. I read lots of books from plenty of genres, but I love coming back to the familiar settings and writing style of the annual John Grisham release. This sequel to The Firm, which I enjoyed re-reading in preparation (remembered none of it because I read that book as teenager), goes way way waaaaay out of the comfort zone. It was very international and very New York Upper-East side, with just a taste of the Memphis setting with what I thought would be a sub-plot that connected somehow, but it never panned out. It was still very good, very evocative, and I did enjoy it. It was my fault that I bought it with barely a glance at the synopsis, and I will do the same thing next year, without a doubt. I might dig up another old Grisham book from the 90's that I can't remember and enjoy it to console myself.",book
"This new book follows the story of Mitch McDeere from THE FIRM, 15 years after he and wife Abby escaped from the Chicago mob with their lives. They now live in NYC with 2 boys, with Mitch a lawyer in a worldwide law firm that requires lots of travel. Very little about his earlier life spills into this book until the end. The story involves the abduction of one of Mitch's colleagues in Europe by a Middle East group of seeming terrorists. Mitch flies all over trying to negotiate and gather ransom money. Abby is also pulled into the fray. I'm not sure a sequel to THE FIRM was needed, but this story is interesting and different, with its international flavor.",book
"They're back ...... Mitch and Abby McDeere from ""The Firm"" return in this new tale by Grisham.The McDeeres are no longer naive new college grad's facing an uncertain future. They are now parents and seasoned world travelers who are now comfortably settled down in excellent jobs. Life is good, they are living the life they had always dreamt for themselves until.....Mitch is asked for assistance on a case by his good friend. What ensues can only be described as a living nightmare perpetrated by truly sick, insane people. Mitch and Abbys well ordered, comfortable life comes to a screeching halt, as do many others who survive the ordeal.Known for his legal battle books, this one took a twist that reads like a political, espionage/spy thriller. It was unexpected. Parts of the descriptive parts of this book gave me almost overwhelming feelings of nausea .... all to reminiscent of how I felt when I used to watch the news in the late 80's, 90's and early 2000's.....truly sick of what mankind does to each other in their respective searches for domination, greed, prestige and fame.That said, I read this book from cover to cover in one sitting because it certainly kept some of the when, where and how questions unanswered until the very end and because it was a book by John Grisham, a excellent writer and world class story teller.",book
"This is not your typical John Grisham book. Thereâs a lot to read through in some moments of good excitement. But virtually all of the book is lawyers maneuvering back-and-forth to deal with a problem. The ending is somewhat satisfactory although thereâs a part of me that would like to see some sense of justice established. However, itâs kind of fun to read about Mitch and Abby again. So if you enjoyed the firm, I think youâll enjoy this book.",book
"Good job on this ""after The Firm"" book. I enjoyed the short trip down memory lane from The Firm, the vivid descriptions of places and the gruesome action but I believe you might have cut this short without revealing WHO did it and WHY?Does thus mean the next book will provide all the details and possibly the back story for those violet individuals seeking a $100 million dollar pay day...?",book
"Its hard to call a book set 15 years after the first book a continuation of the McDeere story. Its a good read. But I have a problem with the whole story being based on saving a hostage by paying terrorists. Yes every life is important but giving millions to terrorists will cost many more lives and sets a terrible precedent. However in that context, Grisham does weave an exciting tale with many exotic locations and the book is good if you are a Grisham fan.",book
"Really enjoyed this book. The first few chapters I loved- great way to connect The Firm to The Exchange.There are some plot twists I didn't see coming, and the story was riveting, especially with the war in Isreal and Gaza.The reason for 4 stars instead of 5- I felt the last third or maybe quarter was a little drawn out unnecessarily.Grisham doesn't always wrap his books up like you'd expect, but the ending felt right.Great read overall.",book
"I was disappointed that this was not vintage Grisham.The Exchange was a follow up to The Firm from"" 15 years earlier.""This book was not as exciting and was anachronistic regarding current technology in a setting in Libya before M.Ghafaffi was toppled.Hopefully, if Hollywood picks up the rights,a good screenwriter can spice it up enough to entice Mr.Cruise to lead as Mitch McConnell Deere again.Good Luck!",book
"I enjoyed reading this book with my youngest âSwifties.â I was originally looking for something geared toward a slightly higher age range, but I knew the quality of Little Golden Books and figured this would be easy to read but still enjoyable. There was some easily digestible info in this book for kids and it made them more interested in learning about Taylor Swift. Though I sometimes feel like I am dragging some of them to reading, this book made them want to seek out more information on their own. They actually asked for more advanced information so they could continue to learn. Though I think of the Little Golden Books as too young, this may be a good way to entice them to read.",book
"Adorable book! I bought this for my toddler and she loves it. I, myself, am a Swifty so I enjoyed reading the book as well. It begins to tell about Taylorâs childhood then goes into detail up to when she wrote her 1989 album. (If only they waited to write the book until now- during the Eras Tour.) It is written in a language that is easy for kiddos to understand (I would say 6 years old+) and has pretty colors.",book
"This book is super cute and worked perfect for a Taylor Swift movie bday party we attended. I paired it with a pink Stanley cup and I thought it was the cutest gift. I gifted it to an 8 year old but I think any Swiftie would love this book, no matter the age.",book

"My daughters (7 year old twins and 3 year old) and I are obsessed with Mo Willems' books. My twins started memorizing his books when they were 2 years old, so of course we were very excited for a new Pigeon book!That persuasive pigeon is always up to something! I love the story. It's like the others, but unpredictable, so it was so much fun to read and I'm looking forward to reading it many more times. There's also a little ""Easter egg"" hidden on the page with the fireplace, and my daughters noticed it right away! I just saw stockings at first, but they knew! I don't want to spoil it for Mo Willems fans, so that's all I'll say. ;)And the ending really made me hopeful for another Pigeon book. I sure hope he'll write more, because we love them!It's another cute book, but what I love most about Mo Willems' books is that they're enjoyable no matter how old you are and they're educational. Toddlers love the silly characters and their lines, which they quickly memorize, and then that encourages them to read.One of my twins was reluctant to practice reading sometimes, but she was always in the mood for Pigeon or Elephant and Piggie books. They really helped with her confidence. Both of them started reading chapter books last year, but we'll always enjoy Mo Willems' books. Of course I got ""Be the Bus,"" which is targeted towards adults, too.I definitely recommend this book for any age and it would make a wonderful Christmas gift! We just couldn't wait until then and had to read it now. :)",book
"My granddaughter is a fan of Mo Williems books and ""Don't Let the Pigeon Drive the Bus"" is one of her favorites. I knew this one would be along the same lines and would be just as cute. Mo Williems never disappoints. This is a fun addition to our Christmas library and makes a great Christmas gift or a book to read to little ones for the holidays.",book
"Iâve been a fan of the author for a really long time. If I counted correctly, this will be the 11th book we have (including Be the Bus).Even though my children are teenagers, they do not want to give them away (especially my youngest). When they were little, they loved telling the pigeon NO! Now, they get to carry on this tradition and help Santa.Highly recommend!",book
Darling story with the Christmas twist! We love the Pigeon and Elephant and Piggy books! My kids read over and over.,book
Purchased several books!Copyright 2023 !!Gifted one to a kindergarten teacher and a second grade teacher and nephews !It's an engaging book for young readers !,book
Mo Willems is my favorite author of all time. I adore this book and any book about the Pigeon. His adventure on the sleigh brings the joy of the pigeon and his naughty side with the love of Winter.,book

Funny story. Very good price & service. Secure packaging.Thank you Vendor!,book
I babysit kids 3 & nearly 5 years and they think this book is funny. I'm a little nervous that they won't want to eat the turkey on Thanksgiving though... Ha!,book
Iâm a preschool teacher and the kids in my class loved this book! We did a disguise the turkey activity along with it and it was perfect. Definite read for thanksgiving!,book
Both of my boys came home with a paper turkey to decorate in disguise for thanksgiving to make him less noticeable! This is the perfect book to help with imaginative ideas. Thanks for the fun read!,book

"Psychiatrist, professor, world-class researcher, and traumatologist Bessel van der Kolk MD requires no introduction to trauma psychotherapists. My enduring impressions of him over many years is one of relevance, cogency, frankness, and accessibility - served up with a subtle dash of impishness. He tends to be a bit disruptive - something of a provocateur - and everything of his I have ever read has taught me something, confirmed something important, or pushed my thinking in a new direction. When he has something to say, I want to hear it.However, I almost didn't buy this book: I was put off by the title. Familiar with major reviews of PTSD psychotherapy outcomes research, I know that research support for body-oriented approaches to treating psychological trauma psychopathology is thin at best, and such treatment models simply do not have the research validation of either EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing) and PE (Prolonged Exposure), neither of which are especially body-focused.J. Interlandi's excellent article anticipating publication of this book - ""A Revolutionary Approach to Treating PTSD"" (New York Times Magazine, 2014.05.22 - available online) - initially supported my fears that for some inexplicable reason van der Kolk was now promoting some treatment model for which we have little confirming research. ""Psychomotor therapy is neither widely practiced nor supported by clinical studies,"" Interlandi informs us. Provocateur he may be, but I'm strongly biased in favor of paying attention to therapies for which we do have solid empirical validation. Our clients do not deserve to be experimental subjects - maybe not even if they agree to this, as I'm not sure they can ever know enough to make a truly informed consent. Knowledge that PTSD and related disorders are usually highly curable, when using the right treatment protocols, sadly remains the possession of a minority of people, even in the professional psychotherapy world.Yet the account of van der Kolk's therapy work in Interlandi's article is gripping. Becoming completely absorbed in the account, I was convinced. (I've been here before, reading van der Kolk's own accounts of his work.) And so the disruption begins! Deeper into the article, he has me. Van der Kolk's critique of CBT (cognitive behavioral therapy - a general class of therapies) and PE (E. Foa's exposure therapy model) is withering and correct: neither really work. ""Trauma has nothing whatsoever to do with cognition...It has to do with your body being reset to interpret the world as a dangerous place....It's not something you can talk yourself out of."" Interlandi reports that ""That view places him on the fringes of the psychiatric mainstream.""But he's right, and I can't stress this enough. Why? Because as a trauma treatment professional I'm well aware of what the trauma treatment outcomes research actually says. The best current summary of this research well may be chapter 2 of Ecker, et al.'s (2012) ""Unlocking the emotional brain"". (Buy this book, too!) Ecker et al. brilliantly presents a synthetic summary that encompasses 11 existing therapy models which actually DO cure trauma psychopathology, if done right. In this context, what van der Kolk is doing makes perfect sense. Finally, it appears, the trauma psychotherapy field is moving toward a consensus which has strong credibility.Van der Kolk's new book has many virtues. Parts One and Two (102 pp) provide a substantial review of the neuropsychology of trauma's impact on a person. It's fun, interesting, informative reading, for professional and layperson alike. Part Three (64 pp) surveys childhood development, attachment experience, and ""the hidden epidemic of developmental trauma"". Van der Kolk has for years been a leading champion of the idea that there is a type of PTSD which substantially differs from all the rest. It develops in response to chronic child abuse and/or neglect. I completely share his belief that the diagnosis of Developmental Trauma Disorder (sometimes called C-PTSD, with ""C"" meaning ""Complex"") is overdue for formal recognition. I find his review of the struggle to legitimize DTD as gripping and distressing as anything else in the book. It is anguishing to know that a major problem exists, AND that the psychiatric establishment simply refuses to acknowledge it. DTD/C-PTSD is no fantasy. We see and treat these people, as children and adults. They exist, and they are nothing like ""ordinary"" PTSD treatment clients.Part Four (29 pp) focuses on memory. I've long thought that much writing on treating psychological trauma seems to miss the point: trauma memory is what causes the problem. Deal with that and the symptoms vanish. Why is this so hard to understand? Yet, it is not a common understanding at all. Explaining how trauma memory works is invariably enlightening to my clients. And experiencing what happens when we change the nature of trauma memory is revelatory to someone who's lived with it for years, if not decades. As he does throughout the book, van der Kolk offers fine stories about clients who have experienced exactly what I've seen happen in my clients, making excellent use of what cognitive research tells us: people understand things best through narratives. Offer a good narrative and you convince.Psychological trauma therapy is complex, but we are now well prepared to launch into the book's core content - Part Five (154 pp), ""Paths to Recovery"". He gets right to it: we cannot undo the trauma, but we CAN undo its effect on us, and so get our ""self"" back. Ch. 13 reviews existing therapies. His approach is to repair ""Descartes' Error"" (see DamÃ¡sio's 1994 book of that title) by viewing mind and body as a single coherent functional unit. His topical coverage is complete and his critique of current therapies acute - not to be missed.He then writes of the importance of language (Ch. 14). We construct our narrative mainly in words, and the words we choose are critical. But language is not enough (this anticipates his next two chapters). Our senses encompass a larger world, and it's center is our body, where all our sensory receptors are located. Then he introduces the treatment model he's long advocated: EMDR (Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing). I'm trained in EMDR, and in fact van der Kolk and I had the same instructor for our advanced training: Gerald Puk PhD. Van der Kolk tells an amusing and self-deprecating story about his advanced training experience, in which Puk was able to provide a strong corrective to his approach to clients. This is typical van der Kolk - he's a truth-teller, even when it may put him in a poor light! And,after all, at this point he has nothing to prove to anyone.Finding an EMDR therapist is not hard (see his ""Resources"" section). Nor is it hard to find a yoga instructor, and yoga is what he advises for helping a trauma victim get back into their body. Yoga is a wise choice, because it is available, already widely known, and adaptable to a wide range of individuals and capabilities.There is much more in Part Five, and the focus is on self-empowerment. ""Victim no more!"" as they say. Most trauma therapists have a keen interest in seeing their clients leave therapy charged up and ready to fully embrace their life - that certainly is my own emphasis. Van der Kolk's thoughts on self-empowerment for those in recovery from psychological trauma will be invaluable to any trauma psychotherapy client.For psychotherapy professionals, this book will be both delightful and confirming. For everyone else, it will be a readable, gripping, highly educational tour of topics all of which are critical to a successful transition back from the impact of psychological trauma. That he gives prominent though not dominating emphasis to developmental trauma disorders is entirely appropriate. Our society has yet to grasp that child abuse and neglect is a more often chronic than not, and that its impact is largely ignored and poorly treated, if at all. This does not have to be. Get educated (this book will do that), then commit to being an advocate for children as well as for adults impacted by trauma. They all deserve the chance to be healed, and we can now do that. Van der Kolk shows us how.The physical book: Jacket design is pleasant and interesting. Binding is less so: color of spine wrapping is semi-florescent, and of paper, not cloth. The book feels substantial and pleasant to hold and look at.Organization -* 6 pp: prefatory praise by peers and related luminaries (interesting comments from some important people in the field);* 2 pp: Table of Contents;* 356 pp: actual text;* 4 pp: Appendix: Consensus proposed criteria for developmental trauma disorder* 3 pp: Resources* 4 pp: Further reading* 51 pp: Notes* 21 pp: Index",book
"Of all the non-fiction books I've read, this is by far the best one ever. I grew up in a tough way. Lots went wrong. My brother and I believed we were unwanted and we had plenty of evidence to back up our sentiment. We suffered shared abuse and individual abuses of every kind imaginable. When I became an adult, I subscribe to the concepts of people like Rush Limbaugh and drove around listening to his radio show proclaiming that there is no such thing as post-traumatic stress disorder. I believed I could gut it out, that the past was the past and that only weak people needed to talk through their problems. I believed only losers behaved badly as adults due to anything in their childhood or past and that claiming you were affected by any past problem was a crutch to allow you to embrace failure. Frankly, for a time, that approach worked for me. I got married, had some great children (still have them thankfully), built a company. But it didn't take too long until it all came crashing down. And, when it did, I spent nearly 1.5 decades down. The anxiety that was always in my throat and chest was, to put it mildly, a distraction. It's very hard to be kind to people, to focus on your work, to love others when all your power is spent trying to pretend you don't feel like s***. When you can't sleep because your heart is beating so forcefully that the entire bed is vibrating - at least it feels that way - you not only lose the joy of sleep, but you feel hopeless and miserable and even more so when you're not able to understand why you feel this way. When you see everything you have go away and can only occasionally find the strength to take care of yourself and your business and need others in your life to carry you from time to time (much to your embarrassment) and yet you think you're smart and capable and have no understanding of why you are where you are, life becomes a slog. You trudge through it wishing you were dead or that something would kill you even if, like me, you'd never kill yourself. Literally, when I was a believer, I went to bed every night and my prayers went something like this, ""Dear Jesus, please have a bus run over me. I will never kill myself but I'm miserable. Please let me die so my family won't hate me for killing myself but so that I can stop hating the sun coming up. In Jesus name, Amen."" If you're like I was (and it's hard to tell you how I was and hold the tears down even now), this book will help you change all that. It will describe in detail what you're going through and it captures so many of those subtleties as to make it absolutely amazing. For the first time, I don't have depression (and I don't take pills). I don't have anxiety (it still bubbles up on occasion but using mindfulness, it goes nearly as fast as it comes). My life is pointed in the right direction, my business future is hopeful, my love-life is stabilizing, I know I'll no longer lose friends. I'm finally on track to getting what I want in every area of my life from women to money to friends and deep connections with my family. While I can't attribute every part of my success to this book alone as it takes many things to get where you want to go (mostly you), I can absolutely attest to the power of this book. If you've suffered any sort of major and/or persistent trauma in your life, please buy (and read) this book. You will one day thank yourself for doing so.",book
"This book has been on my reading list for a while and Iâm so glad I finally purchased. It helped give me insight into issues I have from time to time and a good friend immediately borrowed it when I finished. In talking to my SIL I was even able to help her understand some of my brothers behaviors. It has been wonderfully helpful in better understanding myself, the brain, and even how to correct issues. I highly recommend!",book
"Wow! The Body Keeps the Score has so much information in it! Iâm not great at reading technical books, especially if they are science related. Yeah. Iâm more of a language arts and social studies kind of gal! I have gotten better since I taught sixth grade science, but technical brain stuff still confuses me a bit. Thankfully, Bessel Van Der Kolk does his best to explain things so that even I can understand them. I may have needed to reread some paragraphs a couple of times, but I did finally understand it.The Body Keeps the Score is so well written. Like I said, even I was able to understand it. The writing style may be more technical, but it is still usually easy to understand. If youâre like me and know very little about the brain, youâll be good! He does a good job of explaining all the different parts of the brain and how trauma affects each of those parts.I learned a lot from the examples he shares of his clients and how they have reacted to traumatic experiences. Itâs crazy how the same situation can cause such different reactions! In one person the experience can cause the personâs brain to pretty much shut down, while someone elseâs brain in the same experience can cause more of a fight or flight response. I did find it fascinating to learn about these different responses.One of the reasons Iâm glad I read The Body Keeps the Score is so that I will be better prepared and be better able to help my friends, family members, and students who have suffered from traumatic experiences. One of my favorite parts was learning about all the different strategies that can be used to help people heal from their trauma. I knew about a few of them, but I learned about several unconventional methods that will help.I love that healing focuses on body awareness and mindfulness. Itâs all about separating the past and the present and becoming aware of your body. It seems strange, but apparently when you suffer from a traumatic experience, your past and present collide. When something triggers your mind in the present, you feel the same emotions as you did when you first had the experience. At that point it becomes difficult to discern if you are in the present or in the past. Fascinating, right?Content Rating: PG-Profanity: None-Intimacy: Low (Incest and abuse are noted as causing trauma.)-Violence: Low (He does describe some traumatic experiences his clients have experienced.)Age Recommendation: 16+ (Itâs quite technical and younger readers may not fully understand the content or be able to apply the knowledge. There are heavier themes that may not be appropriate for younger readers.)",book
"I have never cried while reading a book before, but that changed reading this book. If you have PTSD or know someone who does, get your handkerchief ready. This was not an easy read for me as it made me realize how much trauma I had buried and forgotten years ago. I am grateful for it as I can now begin working towards healing.I believe this book was written more for mental health practitioners, but it was not written in a way that was difficult to understand or follow. If you have PTSD or know someone who does, I recommend reading through this book.",book

"This book was a required book for one of my courses in college. I LOVED it. Itâs so educational and makes trauma more âmainstreamâ and not just a diagnosis. The importance of collaboration with other professionals is highlighted as well, and a lot of other undead pointed out that needs to be addressed in multiple different jobs/careers. 11/10 phenomenal book",book
"I want to give this book 3.5 stars, but because I think the knowledge in this book is important for the average person to read, Iâll give it 4 stars. I want to preface that the epilogue to this book (âChoices to be Madeâ) is an absolute trash-ridden, garage-filled piece of detritus that doesnât belong anywhere in any sort of literature. It almost convinced me that this author is an absolute shill. However, if one ignores that entire last chapter, then the book itself is actually quite superb (and the author doesnât seem to be a fraud).Trauma is a huge problem in the world. Many subjects in the modern era have really advanced in order to better understand the human brain, mind, and the processes connecting them (mainly due to technological advancements such as the fMRI). I would think that to most people, trauma is something that can detrimentally, and sometimes irreversibly, harm someone. If that someone is a child, this damage is multiplied by a billion. However, what I think that people end up lacking is the knowledge of when/how trauma can form. It isnât just caused by obvious phenomena such as war, natural disasters, tragic family accidents. It can be caused by simple things as well such as verbal arguments, falling off a bike as a child, or a parent working long hours and never seeing his or her child. This is why this book is important. It makes it known that trauma is a lot (or can be a lot) more ubiquitous than people think.The book is broken down into a few sections. I would say about 70% of this book is background, on a variety of subject matter. This certainly could have been shortened down by about 40%, but I suppose more information is generally better (in this case I would likely disagree, as the book itself is already too long, so removing the âfluffâ would likely have been a good idea). The last 30% of the book is about âsolutionsâ to trauma. I wonât go into each chapter and mention every main point, but overall each chapter is worth, at the very least, a heavy skimThe background knowledge on trauma is really interesting. We learn what parts of the brain are activated during trauma (and parts that are activated post-trauma). This help us to understand why people may âfreezeâ during a traumatic experience, why people cant express their feelings when they become âtriggeredâ, and why certain medications work better than others. The information here really opened my eyes as to why people who have experienced trauma can act so strangely and illogically. âJust tell me what emotion you are feeling.â âStop trying to hit me! What the hell do you think youâre doing?â I feel like I can sympathize more with these people and have a better understanding of how to approach them.The solutions to this were quite impressive and honestly seemed fairly simple in nature. Examples include EMDR (which is essentially just a mixture of hypnosis and REM sleep initiation), brain-computer interface technology to control frequencies produced by your brain, talking, yoga, theater, etc. There is no cure-all method, but rather each solution needs to be tailored to each individual. Obviously, drugs are an option here but this merely is a temporary solution and doesnât âfixâ trauma at all.I want to finish this with my negative opinions on this book and the author. Overall, the author seems to be fairly knowledgeable and truly caring. However, this book is full of their bias, and it really shows. A few examples are as follows. The author does a good job at adding references in this book when making claims, but when you pay attention to the location of the references, it is clear that the author is tacitly picking and choosing what they need to reference. For one, the author really hates drugs (and by that I mean medications used to treat people with mental disorders or trauma). He makes that very clear throughout this entire book. So he will reference some statistics that say drug use is bad when he makes a claim. But then a few sentences later he makes another claim that negatively talks about drugs, but doesnât cite any reference. He tries to make you think that the reference 3 sentences ago would also be for this, but in reality it doesnât. I see this as pseudo-science. He thinks he is being clever but in reality he is just being a biased con artist and not even close to a real scientist. As I mentioned early, the epilogue to this book is just atrocious, This is where he gets into politics and tries to tie trauma to all sort of institutions and societal structures. He blames trauma on guns, healthcare, teachers, etc. He think that teachers are to blame (they dont comfort kids enough) and writes off the parents bad behavior at home as âsomething that happens, but the teacher needs to be the âparentâ thenâ. He paints the USA at times as some crazy country where schools and healthcare is years behind what it should be, but doesnât talk about these same exact issues (sometimes even worse) in Western Europe where these political structures are different, but the problem still remains. Iâm very happy this was an epilogue and not an introduction because if it was I would have thrown this book into my compost bin immediately if it was.",book
"Fascinating read! The book gives an insight to the stories of peopleâs struggles, research and solutions.",book
"This book was so very well researched and detailed. The content connected exquisitely with a medication class where we have been learning about body systems and the implications for meditating. As a veteran teacher and administrator in elementary education I connected with how all of a child's experiences form the person they are. Talk therapy applications can help likely more so than medications. The book reminded me of Joseph Chilton Pierce's ""The Magical Child"" and other books regarding childhood development and recovery, especially those books written by occupational therapy practitioners.",book
"This book, with its magic, fairytale roots, and steamy hot romance, deserves ALL of the stars. I loved it!Here are the five reasons why I gave A Court of Thorns and Roses 5 out of 5 stars (and then some):â FAIRYTALE RETELLINGI was a little wary of this story when I discovered that it was a fairytale retelling. I love the story of Beauty and the Beast. Growing up, I watched the Disney version all of the time (but not as much as I watched Pocahontas). However, in the past I have struggled to find enjoyment in Beauty and the Beast retellings. Particularly Beastly by Alex Flinn -- I did not enjoy the book or the movie.I think I was worried that A Court of Thorns and Roses wouldn't feel original, but it was the complete opposite. Maas has written an incredibly unique story that is grounded in the fairytale we all know and love, but is also independent and utter creative genius (Maas is definitely honing and owning her writing skills!). Yes, there is a curse, and magic, and a love story. But there is also dark magic, and steamy romance (and I do mean steamy!), and blood and gore, and court drama -- basically, all of my favorite things wrapped up in one neat, rose-colored bow.There were some twists on the original story of Beauty and the Beast that I really enjoyed. For example, in the original story, the residents/servants of the Beast's home are cursed and transformed into household items. However in ACOTAR, rather than being transformed into household items, Maas' cursed characters must wear masquerade masks, and have done so for 50 years since the curse was placed on the night of a masquerade party. I also appreciated that, though Tamlin was a beast, that quality did not factor into the curse that was placed on him. Rather, as a Fae, he has the power of shape-shifting, and takes the form of a beast (usually when fighting). So, throughout most of the book, Tamlin is portrayed as a glorious, chiseled, man of steel. Some readers believe that the fact that Tamlin is gorgeous retracts from the Beauty and the ""Beast"" story line. However, no one writes hot male love interests like Sarah J. Maas, so I am not complaining about Tamlin at all.Overall, I found that I loved the fairytale background of this story more than anything. I enjoyed drawing comparisons between Maas' story and characters, and the story I grew up with. Maas' world is so intriguing, engrossing you from the very beginning and never letting you go.â GENREWhile we know that ACOTAR is a fairytale retelling, that is not to say that it is a children's book. I went into this book thinking that it was Young Adult. However, there is a particular scene that takes place after the Great Rite on Fire Night (such a good scene, by the way -- just wait for it) that made me take a step back and think ""Whoa! This is way too sexy and erotic for Young Adult literature.""Looking back at Goodreads, I found that the book was listed as Young Adult and New Adult. But, I would personally classify this book as New Adult. Having read many New Adult novels, I found that the sex rating for ACOTAR resonates with that of a New Adult novel. I think that there is a lot of confusion about the genre of this book because we all know Sarah J. Maas as a Young Adult author. I personally have no problem with this genre. However, for parents who are giving this book to their young children, or for those readers who don't enjoy sex scenes in their books -- you have been warned.I love the New Adult genre, and discovering that ACOTAR fell into that genre made me love it even more. I appreciate the more mature content, and that the characters are closer to my age (Feyre is 19). And, hey, I appreciate the sexy times, too. (There is no shame in my game... Because, who am I kidding? I have no game.) I had also never read a New Adult Fantasy before, so I was glad to be exploring new territory.I'm absolutely impressed with Maas as a writer. She is not afraid to be different, to venture out to new places. I love that she is entering this new genre, and look forward to seeing what else she has up her sleeve for the future.â FEYRE, THE PROTAGONISTWhen I started reading ACOTAR, I was sure Maas was going to give us another Celaena Sardothien: a badass girl who is nearly invincible, yet lovable and cool. However, Feye (pronounced Fay-ruh) is so different from other fantasy protagonists I have read, because she is so unapologetically human. She is normal, and she is flawed, and I found that I could easily relate to her character. Feyre is unlike the female protagonists we are accustomed to. She is no fighter, not outstandingly gorgeous, and she is also illiterate (a shortcoming that embarrasses her to not end).In the beginning, Feyre is not very likable. She is cold, harsh, stubborn, and hard-headed. But, readers begin to see how her situation of poverty has shaped her to be that way. Once at the Spring Court, where she is no longer burdened with the responsibility of taking care of her father and two sisters (all of whom are ungrateful of her efforts to keep them alive), the ice in her heart begins to melt as she lives in comfort and takes up her passion for painting. Readers witness her character develop as she begins to rediscover happiness and life's simple pleasures. Feyre easily becomes a character you can't help but root for and love.â TAMLIN & AN IMPENDING LOVE TRIANGLESince we have discussed Feyre, I believe that it is only appropriate to take a glance at her love interest: Tamlin.Tamlin is a bae Fae warrior, with magical abilities. He is also gorgeous, kind-hearted, and strong. And, he places Feyre's happiness and well-being above all else. But, he is not perfect. He is flawed, haunted by his family's past, by his own mistakes, and the lives he has taken. But, through all of that, he still strives to do and be good.However, I admit that while I love Tamlin, I am worried that Maas has a love triangle in the works for Book 2 of ACOTAR.Because Rhysand.Rhys, a sexy, dangerous Fae, is a force of nature who seeks to dig his claws (or rather, talons) into Feyre. And, I can't say that I hate him. I actually like his character, although we witness him do some terrible things (even to Feyre). He seems edgy, fun, and is incredibly witty. (Maas does this thing where she makes you fall in love with all of her characters, even the morally ambiguous ones.) While Tamlin is all gorgeous and good, Rhys has that hot-but-tragic thing going for him.I am already struggling with the love square Maas has going on in the Throne of Glass series (between Celaena and her three love interests -- Chaol, Dorian, and Rowan). I don't think that I will be able to handle the emotional roller coaster of another of her love triangles. But, I think that as long as no one else is introduced, as long as this does not move into the quadrilateral stage, everything will be fine.â SUPPORTING CHARACTERSWhile Maas' main characters are at the center of attention, her supporting characters keep this book afloat. With less focus and fewer appearances, Maas' supporting characters still manage to steal our hearts and the show.First, there is Lucien, the red-haired, one-eyed Fae who is Tamlin's best friend. He is initially rude to Feyre, but eventually warms up to her. They easily develop a sort of big-brother-little-sister relationship. I would consider Lucien to be the story's comic relief. He is humorous and sarcastic and I adore his character.There is also Amarantha, the story's evil villainess. She is a Fae ruler who has a particular hatred for humans, which is not good for Feyre. She is cold, calculating, and cruel. But she has a backstory (all the best villains have backstories). And, I don't want to spoil you all, so I will just say that, when you learn her backstory, you realize why Amarantha is so harsh and unforgiving. Although, while I can sympathize with her on some level, I find her evil ways to be too much at times. However, I still find her to be an interesting, well-written character.And of course, there is Rhysand, whom I mentioned earlier. He is incredibly important to the story of Book 1, and will have an even larger presence in Book 2. I cannot wait to learn more about his character, because he is so enigmatic and intriguing and I just know that I am going to love him.HONORABLE MENTIONSMaas' WritingI believe that ACOTAR is Maas' at her best. As I stated earlier, we are definitely seeing Maas hone and perfect her skill -- each book she releases is always better than the last. What I liked most about Maas' writing in ACOTAR was her use of first person. Throne of Glass is written in third person, and with changing character perspectives. I find that I can tend to get bored with certain characters. But, with ACOTAR, told from Feyre's perspective, I felt engaged throughout the entire book.Faerie WorldI literally want to live in Prythian, in the world of the Fae that exists beyond The Wall (just without all of the drama). Maas depicts the Spring Court so beautifully and vividly. It seems like a literal heaven on earth.Other than the beauty of the Fae world, there are the parties and festivities. I mentioned Fire Night and the Great Rite earlier, two very interesting festivities held in the Fae world. And then there are parties and gatherings celebrating the seasons, such as Summer Solstice and Midsummer. It is all so fantastical and fun, readers are just dying to step into the pages.***There is not much else I can say about A Court of Thorns and Roses. I LOVED this book! I have no idea how I am going to wait an entire year for the sequel. It's going to be excruciating, but I am sure that it is going to worth it. Because Sarah J. Maas is a fabulous queen of writing, and every word she writes turns to gold.",book
"I bought the trilogy. All together they were the best books I've read in a while. Separately, they were not perfect but I'm okay with that. I read a lot and tend to dislike books that show no character growth, or have wishy-washy villains, or have insta-love, or have love result from H saving h from sexual violation, or suffer from deus ex machina. I don't particularly care if something is obvious because sometimes I want to read something that is easy and obvious. My brain doesn't want to be challenged 24/7. Also, I love good dialogue- dialogue makes a romantic connection feel real rather than insta-lovey. Is dialogue action-packed? No. Does it slow down pacing? You bet. At this point, you're probably wondering where this review is going? Well, I think that knowing more about me as a reader might make it easier to see/ relate to my views for this book.Now the fun stuff! ***SPOILERS***Feyre (the h):This character is complex and goes through several changes throughout the series. In this book, she has her ups and downs. Initially, she is hardened, street-smart and capable with a cynical eye toward romance and happiness and outright hatred and prejudice towards the fae. She also has love for a family who seems to dislike and neglect her. She is not very likeable. But does that make a book bad? No. (Hello, Wuthering Heights.) It is, however, more rare to write an h this way because readers in general tend to want to relate to an h, particularly when it's written in 1st person perspective. So many readers might not be able to get into the story because of their dislike for Feyre. When the far remove her burdens that largely drove who she was, Feyre changes. She doesn't have a purpose to keep her going, to shape her. The pacing of the book suffers a bit here while she tries to sort herself out. She tries to make love and painting her new purposes, and while she has the determination to do so, the fit just isn't right. Does this make the book bad? No. While many people won't like to read about an h that seems somehow ""less"" this downward arc was necessary to fuel the inevitable reversal toward a more fitting purpose. It drags a bit for sure, but makes the reversal feel more right, more true later on. Did she rush into something with Tamlin. Her feelings do feel a bit rushed but ultimately fit her as a character- going all-in has always been her style from the start. In that sense, the character is consistent. Also, her reluctance to voice her love made me think that deep-down she might have confused love with gratitude. Tamlin was her savior in many ways. For all of these reasons I liked Feyre.Tamlin (the H):Tamlin was the 1st high fae Feyre had any meaningful interactions with in the 1st book. I never really liked him as an H. He was pretty but basically hollow. He struggles with uncontrolled rage. He had just as much hatred for humans as Feyre did for fae, and his elitist attitude was hinted at throughout this book (though not substantiated until book 2). He also adheres to fae tradition in weird ways- his willing participation in the Fire Night ritual is distasteful because it borders on infidelity (especially since we later learn in book 2 that he can designate a replacement). Tamlin has from the beginning been primarily focused on Tamlin. When things get tough, he sends Feyre away; he doesn't consult or listen to her, but just decides, hinting at his desire to treat her like a possession rather than a person. When he gets a moment of freedom under the mountain he attempts to have sex with Feyre (his wants) instead of trying to escape with or save her (her needs). When Feyre is dying, he can only bring himself to beg for her life, he isn't moved into action. All of these things hint that Tamlin is not a good fit for Feyre. Many readers will not like to read about an H that is so lacking/ ill-fitted. The beautiful part is that these things are only ever hinted at in the writing, not outright stated so you will want to root for Tamlin while also feeling something inexplicably lacking in him. I thought about it lots before I picked up book 2, where my thoughts regarding Tamlin were cemented. Tamlin could not have been written more likeable though. If he was the perfect H then Feyre falling for Rhys in book 2 would have felt like a betrayal, instead of fated, and then Feyre would've been worse than unlikable but detestable as an h.Lucian:A secondary character who is both interesting and flawed. He hates Feyre at first, but ultimately warms up to her. He is loyal to a fault, siding with Tamlin over and again, even when he thinks it is wrong to do so. A trait that becomes more obvious as the series progresses. Lucian has potential.Rhysand (villain/other H):Rhysand was the most interesting character in the book (although Nesta was a close second). Rhys was the evil queen's right-hand man. He has done terrible things. Yet, when we meet him (not my favorite bit of the book because of the gross circumstances I do not favor, as mentioned above) there is evidence that he is not all that he seems. He appeared to be interested in Feyre romantically, but the ""why"" part is not there. Also, it is not 100% certain WHAT drives his actions. He is a mystery. Why did he decide to help her time and again? Why, if he likes her did he decide to put her through nightly humiliation? Why use her to torment Tamlin? He is clearly not 100% a good guy. He is complex.Other things people often talk about:The sex. There is a lot more sex in this book than in other ""YA"" books. It seems like that has somehow lead to some amount of controversy. I find that notion very strange as many eons ago when I was a teen, sex was a big part of being a teen- whether or not to have it, who had it, when they had it where and how, what type of birth control to use, etc. Suggestions that a book would have any type of influence on those things are just silly. Teens have sex. It's a fact. Wishing it otherwise does nothing productive. Also, the sex in this series is not ""explicit."" Every time I see this adjective used, it makes me laugh. I have read many romances and even some erotica. If you truly want something ""explicit"" check out erotica- phrases like ""the apex of my thighs"" or the ""the length of him"" are not ""explicit.""The copious dialogue. Lots of readers don't like the extended dialogue and also wish to have seen more of the fae world. I am just guessing here, but I am thinking that they are meaning that they wanted less talk and more fairy magic. But, fae are known for more than just their magic. Another key attribute of fae has to do with their words- being able to only speak in rhyme, only speak the truth, answer any question posed, etc. This attribute can be very interesting (see Mortal Instruments series or Dresden Files). And indeed it was put to use throughout the series, sometimes well done other times much too dues ex machina for my liking. Dialogue can be a type of action when done well enough. In this book, it probably could've been better but was good enough for me.The Fire Night and rape culture. Honestly, I am bothered by this one. I am never fond of rape or sexual violence as a plot device which is why I tend to avoid historical romances almost entirely. In this book, I think the Fire Nite ritual was used in part explain a bit about fae magic and in part to push forward the Feyre-Tamlin relationship while introducing Rhys. I think it both went too far and not far enough. Tamlin's participation cheapens his feelings toward Feyre, just imagine someone saying, ""I love you, truly, but I need to go have sex with someone else."" And then he came back to Feyre AFTER HAVING SEX WITH SOMEONE ELSE, and bit her to clearly show his possession of her. It doesn't sit well, does it? Additionally, the three fae with bad intentions suggest to Feyre that fae tradition gives them the right to violate her just because she is present. That makes all fae seem brutal and detestable. Thus, it goes too far. But, what about the converse? The Fire Night ritual is supposed to be necessary to ensure the bounty of the land for the next year. But, the spring court is the only court that has/ observes this ritual en mass? That does not really make sense to me. The need for this ritual, especially considering mated bonds are a rare and extremely valued thing, is not properly explained. It really could've been omitted from the book and is one of the few things about the book that I truly did not like.The masks. Some people like them, some don't. The reason given for them was that they were yet another obstacle to a human girl falling in love with Tamlin. I really didn't mind them but I did not like Feyre's reaction to the removal of the masks. While it was consistent with her character (she always had an eye for pretty guys), I thought that it cheapened her character to have her feel relieved that Tamlin was so pretty without his mask. It was very superficial, and further proof that there wasn't much of substance to their ""love.""While book 1 is my least favorite of the series, I still really liked it and will definitely re-read it again. Books 2 and 3 get even better and I am looking forward to further writings as well. Hopefully we will get to see what happens to Nesta, Elaine, the 6th queen, and Bryaxis.",book

"Having heard much raving about this series, I was poking around on Amazon when I saw this collector's edition. It is indeed gorgeous, although I do wish it had a ribbon attached to the book to use for a bookmark. The gold image that flows from the front cover to the back and the texture of the cover are far more appealing than the plain, paper, black covers that are on most hardbacks today, and that alone justifies its presence on the shelf. It wasn't the first time I had bought a book for the cover.Aside from hearing reviews from fans, I also saw a reference to the book when reading about Patricia A McKillip's _Winter Rose_, which I had recently read, and its connection to the ballad of Tam Lin. This same fairy tale apparently had influence on Holly Black's _Tithe_, also. Although the High Lord in Maas's tale is named Tamlin, the story is obviously a retelling of ""Beauty and the Beast."" The story also has borrowed pages from the fairy tale ""East of the Sun, West of the Moon,"" wherein the main character is taken away from her family by the bear, and the bear prince makes her impoverished family rich. Whereas neither ""Beauty and the Beast"" nor ""East of the Sun, West of the Moon"" have fairy characters, aside from a witch or enchantress here and there, in the story Tam Lin, he is identified as an elf. In Maas's retelling, which court is cursed to wear masks, Tamlin's friend's mask is clearly stated as a fox, whereas Tamlin's mask is only vaguely described, and he is often referred to as a ""beast."" The lack of description was a tad infuriating.While set in a fairy tale period of time past, the main character clearly has ""modern"" ideas. She has no mother and a weak father figure and, furthermore, was tasked by her dying mother to take care of her sisters, despite the fact that she is the youngest. The family has only recently fallen into poverty, and the main character's upbringing has been neglected. She learns to hunt to feed the family, and, unlike the book-loving Belle of the Disney fairy tale, no one bothers to teach her how to read, although she is presented with a library, at which point, if you were ever in doubt as to which fairy tale was being emulated, you now know for sure. According to the Internet, the character's name ""Feyre"" means ""Fair, Beautiful,"" like the name ""Belle."" DYSWSDT? I myself am not a fan of retellings, and even less of ""modern"" retellings, although I do appreciate influences and notes here and there.As a novel, the story has a single plot line. I have always felt that a story can be a single plot line told in a linear fashion, but a novel requires a bit more substance. Although it was interesting enough for me to finish, I am not sure that I feel compelled to read the rest of the series, particularly if there is no matching collector's edition. For me, the most interesting parts were the three tasks at the end, and I had already guessed the answer to the riddle. I found Feyre's modernity and rebellion to be tiresome and in direct contrast to what readers who like fairy tales would desire, and I found her difficult to like, which is basically how I feel about most ""strong female characters."" I do not understand how a person who is stubborn and illogical is strong. Stubborn, I can get. Stubborn and dumb at the same time? No.ACOTAR has a Lexile score of 880, which puts it at the lower end of a 4th grade reading level (700-1160). You won't learn any new big words, and the prose is clearly more commercial than literary and follows the ""hero's journey"" template little to no deviation (i.e., no big surprises). It is known near the beginning of the book that the main character is no virgin, and there are racy scenes past the middle of the book, as well as being intoxicated and hints of something like a lap dance while being scantily clad in later chapters. The descriptions of the fairy land (not merely a realm) were not as detailed as those in Julie Kagawa's _The Iron Fey_ series and were mundane and too similar to the lands of the mortals. The writing was a bit awkward at several points where one character's actions were in the same paragraph with another character's dialogue, so there was a bit of a whiplash effect for the reader, and the book could have used a good editor to clean up those areas. So, was it bad? Obviously not that bad, since I finished it. Will I read more of her stories? I can't say for sure, but probably not unless they issue an attractive collector's edition worthy of the bookshelf. It satisfied my curiosity, but for Fey-related books, I recommend Jim Butcher's Dresden Series and Julie Kagawa's Iron Fey Series. Both have mind-blowing descriptions and intricacies. I'm always interested to read other authors and series that would do a better job on this topic just to see if it's possible. So, I gave it three stars for being ""okay"" plus one for a really nice cover.",book
"I'd had this series on my TBR for ages. ""A Court of Thorns and Roses"" burst onto the scene a good eight years ago and hasn't let up on Instagram and TikTok, like that friend who's always the center of attention. Let me be clear: fantasy isn't usually my cup of tea, but the incessant chatter about these books made me feel like I was missing out. So, I finally embarked on ACOTAR, and it was a slow start, to say the least. I'd read a bit, then it would gather dust for days, weeks, and sometimes months. World-building felt a bit like trying to join a conversation in a foreign language - bewildering.Around the two-thirds mark, though, the book finally caught my interest. The story took a turn for the better, but then it seemed like the book was about to conclude, and yet it carried onâ¦and on. All said, the writing in this book is truly impressive. The characters are finely detailed and genuinely engaging. At its core, the story is a sort of Beauty and the Beast reinterpretation. But let's be clear, this is no standard fairy tale. After Beauty falls for the Beast, there's a lot more in store. The Beast has hidden depths, and Belle isn't your typical Disney princess. I now get why folks adore this series. I'm currently immersed in the second book, and it's progressing at a brisk pace. Everything's set up, and I'm beginning to feel like I've joined the ranks. With excitement and a cup of coffee in hand, I'm eagerly anticipating the adventures that await in the rest of the series. Bring on the sequels!",book
"âBecause your human joy fascinates me- the way you experience things, in your life span so wildly and deeply and all at once, is â¦entrancing.

"So here I sit, having gone through the OMG ACOTAR SERIES IS AMAZING phase, and out the other end, I can sit back and think ""What the actual hell?""I'm a HUGE Maas fan, so when I found out she was writing another series, I had to have it. For the first time in a long time, my library actually got the book within a month of its release, so I checked out ACOTAR and read it in a single day. I loved it.Books two came out, and while I was super disappointed in the pointless sex thrown in every so often and whole chapters dedicated to this nonsense, I continued reading because the story was compelling enough. And then ACOWAR emerged, and everything changed.This was a series I read numerous times before ACOWAR came out, and I saw things that genuinely bothered me, but I ignored them (I don't even know why) until I just couldn't stand it anymore.ACOTAR is nothing more than erotica. I feel like the series as a whole started out with plans of being some sort of ""story"" porn that has a kick-ass plot with ""hot"" scenes thrown in for whatever reason, and then it got to ACOWAR and decided it wanted to be The Bachelor or a soap opera instead.The relationship between Tamlin and Feyre GREATLY disturbs me. She's taking care of her family and he swoops in after she accidentally kills a fae (who was disguised as a wolf int he woods where hunters hunt...) and takes her away, claiming she's going to be in trouble and damned and blah blah. No, she's pampered and given servants and pretty clothes and good food. Tamlin dresses her up like a doll and makes snide remarks when she falls short of his goals (fae goals, mind you).Feyre is a HUMAN. Tamlin is fae. He acts like her humanity is a curse or something to hold against her, and he constantly makes remarks about how she's too fragile, too uneducated, too plain, etc. Instead of ""fixing"" these issues, Tamlin does nothing other than tell her what to do and not do.He sexually assaults her after Calanmai, and in the book Feyre shows how much she does not want his advances, and he shoves her against the wall and BITES her, then tells her not to ever go against him again. How is this OK? If my husband ever did this to me, I'd kick him in the crotch and leave. This is not OK. This is not a relationship. This is abuse, which is why it disgusts me that people go on and on about Tamlin.The fact that Feyre and Tamlin have sex at a later time after he did this makes it worse. why, Feyre, are you going to throw yourself at a man who A) Doesn't care about you based off his degrading comments and B) threatens you. Not only that, he basically blames her for a near-rape experience when he literally did nothing to look out for her and/or stop the guys who were going to attack her?That being said, I have a lot of issues with Feyre. She gets off too easy on everything, and it's like her brain is only wired to care if the dude is hot. You take care of your family, but then you walk into Tamlin's embrace after the things he has said and done. I understand she has been abused by this, but at the same time, she could have said no. Death is a lot better than basically being a sex slave or punching bag to an immortal person determined to imprison you until you die.She's never punished for killing a fae. Lucien and Tamlin tell her about magical creatures that could give her what she wants, and the next day she walks out and finds them...the elusive creatures...that are hard for fae to find?Lucien is about the only well developed character, and he's too sexualized sometimes for me to take me seriously. If you keep pointing out the abs, tanned skin, or whatever on the dude, you're turning them into a slab of meat. All of the males, and truthfully the females as well, in ACOTAR are ""perfect"" in the idea of what today's society thinks is beauty, sexy, and amazing at everything. This is sexist on every account. Your characters become nothing more than fantasies--which is why I say this is nothing more than porn/erotica.Sure, you can get some great messages out of this series, but is it worth all of the dung in the way? Specifically with the later books, there's too much sex at some points for it to even be OK. Please, go try to have sex that many times or for days on end and tell me how that is. if you can do that, I'm sorry, but you're either a whore or you're just kinda crazy, because that's too much.Why I ever read this book and like it, I truthfully don't know, but I'm done with this series. I'm done with this fandom, and I'm fed up with seeing people ""swoon"" or make comments or even draw/like at that nude art about LITERARY CHARACTERS. Guys, seriously? This is not a book for young girls, but when I went to the first (and last) Maas event, most of the audience there were between the ages of 14-20 (predominately 15-17 years of age) and SCREAMED when Maas was mentioning SEX SCENES. I'm not going to continue to support a series that is encouraging young teens and young women to have unrealistic ideas of men as well as sexual fantasies, especially the married women who I've seen act this same way. if I were your husband, I wouldn't be able to deal with that. I wouldn't want those books in my house.About the only good thing I have to say for ACOTAR was that there actually was a plot in this book, and it was good, if insanely slow to get rolling, and the amount of sex was fairly minimal.",book
"à®Beauty and the Beast meets Faerie à® â I should ADORE this but overall it was just okay. There are things I totally loved about this story, but they are marred by the things that didnât quite work out for me and so what Iâm left with is feeling in the middle where I didnât love it but I didnât hate it either.Iâm a huge fan of beauty and the beast retellings or most fairytales actually, but Belle is my absolute favorite heroine because she is smart, reads and doesnât fall head over heels for the first pretty face that happens along. She and I could totally be BFFs. Then there is the Fae. Now Iâm not a big expert on faerie stories or anything like that, but I find the Fae to be totally interesting creatures and usually like it when they are incorporated into stories. Instead if this being a magical mashup that made the story soar to new heights of awesome I found myself seeing some serious sour notes that disjointed the story and made it feel clunky.The stuff I totally LOVED ââ§ - Tamlin and his Faerie world - There are some really interesting descriptions of the time spent at the his manor. The lake full of starlight, the manor, the art and his court cursed to all be in masks. Tamlin is completely likable right from the near beginning.â§Lucien â He is a spunky guy full of vim and vinegar that Fayre has a lot of fun verbally sparring with and getting into general trouble. He is also a great friend to Tamlin and I love the brotherly bound between them. While Lucien has an easy way with people he is working hard to help his friend find the right way to woo Fayre.â§ The Love Story â I enjoyed the time Tamlin and Feyre were getting to know each other and the tentative flirting the best. I really wish there was maybe just a little more time spent on it as it was the basis for the last 40% of the book.âMy father once told me that I should let my sisters imagine a better lifeâa better world. And I told him that there was no such thing.â I ran my thumb over his mouth, marveling, and shook my head. âI never understoodâbecause I couldnât â¦ couldnât believe that it was even possible.â I swallowed, lowering my hand. âUntil now.ââ§ The âTasksâ â I like the idea behind completing some challenges to prove your worth and love. I liked even more that it was Feyre The Girl who had to do this instead of prince charming. It was a nice twist to a normal Fairytale.â§ - The Curse â while not particularly a fan of the fact the curse made Tamlin and his court all have to wear masks (since I really thought it would have been better if they all had to remain in animal form) I did like the final symmetry and cruelty of the curse. It was different and I totally respect that, it was a truly Fae curse in the level of cruelty behind it.â§ Rhysand â was my FAVORITE CHARACTER and Iâll totally admit Iâm still not sure what exactly I think of him. I will say this though, he is the most interesting character in the book whether he is playing on the side of good or evilâ¦.well you will have to make your own decision on that. But I seriously hoping the next book is about him.As this is the start of a new series I will give it some leeway at getting started. There are some really fun parts to the story and even though it is a bit clunky at times I still got to a point when they are âUnder the Mountainâ that I needed to get through the story to see how it all worked out and this is where the story mostly stayed on the like side of the line.The stuff that missed the mark:â¦ - When writing about a well-established lore I think there are some things that perhaps the reader will âacceptâ or ânot acceptâ based on how important or ingrained it is OR the story the author puts with the lore change. Based on my various readings there are a few things about fantasy creatures that are ingrained into me. I KNOW thatâ Vampires â Drink blood, Canât be in the sun and die by a wooden stake through the heartâ Werewolves â Silver bullets, Shifting (of some kind), Full Moonâ Fae â Immortal Tricksters, CANâT LIEâ Zombie â Human dead, eat fleshIâm not going to say the Maas changed the Fae lore so much that she *Stephanie Meyerâd* it but she pretty much made a change to the Fae lore equivalent to making vampires sparkle in the sunlight. It isnât quite a deal breaker for me, but Iâm not a fan of that particular lore twist either.â¦ It pains me to say this but Feyre and I didnât get along until about 75% of the way through the book. She does so many stupid things that honestly I went from really liking her in the very beginning of the story to being completely annoyed with her.She began strong and independent with a family to support and I really liked that she wasnât your typical virgin heroine. She hunted for her family and was the main supporter. Not conventionally educated she still came across as bright and strong.After ending up in Tamlinâs court and promising to stay the first thing Feyre tries to do is escape, when Tamlin assures her that he has seen to her familyâs comfort she pouts and tries to find a way to escape again. She puts herself in dangerous situations without much thought in these attempts and really it was slightly tiresome.âWerenât you warned to keep your wits about you?â Tamlin snapped. âThat your human senses would betray you?âHe stepped beyond me and let out a snarl so vicious that whatever the thing was by the gates shimmered with light and darted out as fast as lightning streaking through the dark. âFool,â he said to me, turning. âIf youâre ever going to run away, at least do it in the daytime.âI liked her a little more after she calmed down and decided to stay but the damage was done and she never made much headway with me again until toward the very end of the book when she became much more likable.â¦The Curse â( Yes I know that it is up in the like part as well, you get +5 points because you noticed) - The story made it seem like it was so horrible to be cursed to wear the masks but honestly I thought it made Tamlin hotter instead of diminished. Masks are sexy I donât care who you are just think about it Zorro, Phantom of the Opera, a slew of superheroes ANDâ¦.The Dread Pirate RobertsTamlin had a beast form so I thought it would have worked possibly better if she had to fall in love with only his personality. Just an opinion.â¦The âRiteâ â There is a moment in the book where there is a spring festival. Iâm not a prude I swear but it really bothered me how that played out. The whole scene made me feel a little strange and I really wasnât sure what to do with my feelings about it. Maybe if I knew some other Fae stories and knew that was what âThe Riteâ of spring was I wouldnât have minded but I was not prepared. On a good note I was happy that it didnât have any negative residual affects between Feyre and Tamlin.Overall Thoughts:Sometimes at the beginning of a new series you canât see the big picture and that is why the first book of it might fall a little flat for you. I will say that when I read Throne of Glass it was just an okay book for me as well but then I loved both Crown of Midnight and Heir of Fire. Iâm hoping that is also the case with this series.Based on how the book ended I have some really high hopes for the next book of this series. If you like fairytale retellings or Faerie stories then I say still give this one a go. If anyone can deliver a stronger second book to a series it is Maas so Iâm not concerned and think she could be off to a solid start.Begs Sarah J. Maas to have the next book be about Rhysand and dare I hope for it..â¦.Nesta",book
"Iâve read books 1-3 in this series, and despite the plot being great (especially between the two main lovebirds in book 2), I donât plan to keep reading. The chronic excessive explanation with surroundings in the environment and feelings, almost worded as if taken from poetry books to a point of where it doesnât even make sense sometimes, just keeps taking away from enjoying the plot already. I just want to get to the point of what matters between characters, and though itâs normal to have it drawn out in most fictional relationships to keep the suspense, this series just did it too much for my liking. Took way to long for the story to finally bring to light what the heck is going on between Az and Mor, only for it to not even be that âout thereâ of a reason, theyâve existed for hundreds of years and still havenât found a way to talk about her real reasons for not wanting him? Poor Az, thatâs just damn cruel and cowardly of Mor. This is a great series, but itâs definitely for the younger mind. When the interesting scenes between the 2 main lovebirds starting getting less and lessâ¦interest to read last two books gone. There were a lot of gray areas between the different characters relationships, in a way my mind got tired of trying to figure out how they really perceive one another. 4 stars because the plot is still good, not 5 because the depth of connection between characters felt constantly side tracked instead of being put first.",book
"Okay so... I might lost some of my favorite critics over this because I know a lot of you werenât a fan of this book. And I have some pretty intense feelings about some of the biggest criticisms lmao. I will talk about some flaws with the book still, as no book is perfect. But for the most part I really loved it. There will be rants. I have ALOT to say. Sooo here we go before I lose my nerve lmao.My main petty annoyance: the fact that tamlin uses his paws the same way a human uses hands even when heâs in beast form lol. There I said it. Now letâs move on to hopefully not my most controversial review ever. I feel like Iâm supposed to hate MAAS and her writing. But I donât. I really love what she did here.Characters:Feyre:I really donât get the hate. Maybe she gets worse later. Maybe. But people hate her in this book too and I donât get why. She was meh to me. I admired her in some ways and hated her in others. I loved her heart, and how often she let it guide her even if it resulted in her ignoring everything anyone told her. Which yes- did annoy me sometimes. But it wasnât that bad.now we get to the fun part.Tamlin and rhyes (similar thoughts on both)-Oh my god. The reasons you guys hate this dude are absurd in this book. Every single thing I was told to look out for and that would start me into hating him was ridiculous. I genuinely believe you guys just donât ship him and feyre so that makes him immediately sooo horrible. Same for the rhyes haters.You guys have to stop inserting in a fantasy setting and acting like any of the decisions made are simple. Both of them are great in their own way- and both had feyres interest in mind in my opinion. The questionable things they do, because yes there are some...Are either for show to SAVE feyre and everyone else. Itâs all so obviously calculated and here you guys are trying to critique it like theyâre events that happened over tea in a totally normal world with nothing intense or life threatening going on around them. Just why.Iâm team Rhys just because I like him a little more- and I love the way he thinks and speaks. But I also love tamlin and am still rooting for him to be happy.I think theyâre both fleshed out brilliantly and have many layers that I canât wait to uncover. They both have scars and they BOTH have really unfortunate situations that are eating away at them that make them who they are. Iâm just saying... think about the alternative that could happen if they didnât make some of their questionable choices.They wouldnât have done half the stuff they did for this one human... if they didnât truly care.Villain-Well sheâs like not very nice lol so of course I donât like her and Iâm not rooting for her but...idk I put her here because I did kind of have a problem with how stupid she seemed to be for someone who was supposed to be cunning. She let certain people get away with way too much, and didnât seem to notice or care. It was strange because then she would just randomly turn into a brutal witch out of nowhere but then let certain things happen other times. Iâm sure some of it was her calculating but... still. It seemed a little weak.Sheâs bitter, brutal and interesting. The ring, will probably haunt my nightmares. She just wasnât as developed.Lucien-I donât want him with feyre but I just wanted to say... despite me liking tam and rhyes... Lucien will forever be my babe. I love him the most. Heâs so complex and heâs been through so much.Heâs witty, intelligent, and overall just cares about people even when he pretends he doesnât. I want nothing but greatness for him lol. His story is heart breaking as well.The rest- this story is filled with intriguing, misunderstood, and terrifying creatures. No complaints there.Her family- feyres family is on my poop list. But I donât hate nesta even now as some of you seem to. Maybe Iâm a mean bitter person... Idk.The plot-Like every plot it has both weak and strong points. I loved seeing the world unfold, and getting to see a good chunk of it before the action started.I did think the twist with the masks and how convenient all of the events were was well... convenient....while it did lead to the most exciting parts, I felt like the point of it was kinda glossed over and the explanation for why things were how they are wasnât too important to the story.But it came over decently- and the ending wasnât terrible. So Iâm happy.I still got the magical yet unsettling experience I wanted. And I canât wait to see more of this world.I really feel like itâs just the cool thing to hate maas and these books now. But I donât see them as problematic as a lot of people seem to. I had an incredibly enjoyable time reading them, and I saw the reasons behind the words .Think what you want about me because of that lol. I will not defend myself for not seeing the issues other people see. I will be continuing.",book
"You know when someone talks to you about a âsad book,â and you immediately think, âwell, someone precious is going to die at the end?â A Little Life has been called tragic, depressing, a masterpiece that you cannot get through without a wad of tissues nearby, and so naturally, I assumed someone would die at the end. I went into this book prepared to not get too attached to the characters, but itâs inevitable to not connect with people who are the subjects of an 800-page book with minimal spacing and tiny font. Iâd like to think I went into this book prepared, but my preparation got me nowhere.This novel does not lead up to a sad ending. Let me explain. Calling this novel âsadâ is a massive understatement. It is 800 pages of tragedy after tragedy, because the âsadâ doesnât follow the pattern we are used to. Itâs not happy and pleasant until the end where something sad happens- no, this book is a depressing hunk of paper with very little happiness in it. A Little Life is a long, winding tunnel spotted with skylights. You walk forward in the darkness with a couple of friends, and you are struck with sadness after sadness. Your friends get lost in the tunnel, you fall and break your arm, and then the tunnel gives you a foot of light where you can look around and take a breather before plunging yourself into the darkness. You donât know whatâs at the end, because the tunnel gives you no hints. You donât know if youâll exit into the open. You donât know if youâll hit a dead-end, but you keep on walking because by this point, your masochism has kicked in and youâre addicted to the torture.We follow the stories of four characters, all college-friends who have moved from Boston to New York City in order to fulfill their dreams. Malcolm is an aspiring architect- timid and shy, whose overbearing parents are his pride and shame. JB is a painter- arrogant, optimistic and full of life, JB is the only one among his friends who is certain he will make it in life. Willem is an actor, calm and steady who has no family but his three best friends. But while the three have their own lives, their bond is strengthened by the presence of one Jude St. Francis. Jude is enigmatic. Despite having been friends for years, nobody knows anything about him; not his ethnicity or his sexuality. They donât know anything about his childhood or his years before attending university. Jude has an injury; an accident severely limited the use of his legs, but nobody even knows how this came to be. But Jude is quiet, and he is kind and generous and dependent. And so the three friends lend their shoulders silently for him to lean on. This book is not set in one time period: years and decades pass, and each character matures, develops and experiences success and the perils of life, sometimes together, other times apart. As the narrative progresses, one thing becomes crystal clear: Jude has gone through an unspeakable childhood trauma. He is fragile and broken, battling so hard with inner demons that never seem to leave him.If youâre looking for a fast-paced, action-packed, plot-centered novel, put this book down and walk far, far away. A Little Life reads more like an in-depth character study than anything else. Despite there being a large, diverse, well-fleshed out cast of characters- make no mistake: this novel is about Jude. This novel is about Judeâs life, his depression, his experiences, his feelings of pain and insurmountable shame. It is a story about Judeâs relationships and his impact on the people around him. It is a story about love and loss, of betrayal and friendship, of perseverance and giving in. And because it follows the story of such a broken, intense young man, it is a difficult read.It is a difficult read in more ways than one. Firstly, it is 800 pages long with very little action, with large chunks of paragraphs detailing the little moments in life, detailing theorems and laws and art and literature. Large chunks that talk about family, sex, career and the meaning of love- things that may not even need to be in the book. These large chunks familiarize you with our charactersâ backgrounds, their introspections and streams of consciousness, their experiences with each other and outside of their immediate relationships. The characters in this novel feel real; more than once, I felt like I could reach out and touch them. They feel like friends, comrades youâve known for a long, long time. Their happiness genuinely excites you, and their sadness genuinely devastates you. You also become so invested in their relationships with each other, almost as if youâre a mediator.Apart from the thematic material, what makes this novel so hard to digest is the characters. Iâm not exaggerating when I say that they feel like friends- watching them suffer through unimaginable things hurt me. I have never felt this way before. Halfway through the book, I had already cried at least twice, excluding the point where I sobbed for ten pages straight. And then again after. Yanagiharaâs empathetic portrayal of human nature, of human decency and monstrosity is so spot-on. I donât know what else I can say.Secondly, it is brutal in its honest, unflinching portrayal of mental illness. There were several moments in this novel where I had to set the book aside and steady my breathing. It is uncomfortable. It depicts self-harm and depression graphically but not gratuitously, with sensitivity without doing it for âthe shock factor.â Finally, the constant jumps in time frame makes this book far from a casual read. You need to keep up. Each âsectionâ takes place a few years after the previous one, but sometimes Yanagihara alternates time within paragraphs as well. One time youâre seeing the friendsâ lives when they are 35, and you jump back in the middle of a paragraph to when they are 28. It can be quite jarring if youâre not paying attention.But having said that, Yanagiharaâs writing is easy to keep up with. Daunting as it may be with its intelligent discussion of many themes (some of which I mentioned above) and the sheer scale of the book, her writing is welcoming. Complex, full of emotion and genuine feeling, full of âquotableâ things without it ever being overbearing or âtoo much.â Authors writing in the literary fiction genre so often give off the impression that they need to prove something, but Yanagihara writes with effortless grace and poise. Sheâs not trying to prove anything; this is her in 800 pages- take it or leave it.But despite all my praises, this is not a perfect book. My main complaint is the length. Bear with me. I have no problems with lengthy books, as long as the length is justified. Many will probably disagree with me, but I felt that the novel could have been cut short by at least 50 or 100 pages. For example, towards the beginning, we get such an in-depth look into JB and Malcolmâs characters, much of which doesnât come back after the first section. Perhaps their backgrounds could have been weaved more seamlessly into the narrative as the book went along. A lot of the objective discussions about science and mathematics were beautifully written, sure, but didnât feel like they needed to be there. But Iâve got to give Yanagihara this: despite the length, and despite the discussions on objective topics, I was hanging on to her every word. I didnât skim a single page- I was just that invested.So, here we are. You and me at the mouth of the tunnel. I made it out, and youâre asking me if you should take the chance. âItâs difficult. Itâs long. Itâs even terrifying at times, but-â and I prod you into the darkness, âitâs also exhilarating and beautiful and one hell of an experience.â",book
"Iâll be blunt upfront. A LITTLE LIFE (2015) by Hanya Yanagihara is the most soul-wrenching novel I have perhaps ever read. In the novel Yanagihara follows in minute detail the lives of four men who become friends, âa clique,â in college and continue to be close into their late fifties. JB Marion begins his work life as a âreceptionist at a small but influential magazine based in SoHo that covered the downtown art scene,â with ambitions to become an artist. Fatherless since he was three, JB is of Haitian descent, tends toward being overweight, and is gay. Willem Ragnarsson, handsome and âliked by everyoneâ starts out as a waiter, but has his eye set on becoming a professional actor on stage and screen. In ways, Malcolm Irvine is the outlier of the group, still living at home with his parents who are a couple of mixed-race. He is wealthy and determined to become an architect. Malcolm appears to be oblivious of his appeal to others, even naÃ¯ve, somewhat confused about his sexuality, and unmindful of his financial situation although generous to his friends and others when they are in need. At the core of the four friends is Jude St. Francis who holds the group togetherânot so much by what he does even though he is considerably bright, loyal, and hard-working, as well as determined to become a prosecutor, but because his friends care about him and Jude has needs. Parentless and with a mysterious past all of which he never speaks about and never having âa girlfriend or a boyfriend,â Jude has trouble with his legs and is frequently in pain. Although he never complains nor asks for help, his friends are very aware of his situation and go out of their way to assist Jude in as tactful of a manner as possible.Mainly set in New York City, as A LITTLE LIFE unfolds, Yanagihara brings into the fold other characters of importance including a doctor, Andy Contractor, and a former law professor, Harold Stein and his wife Judy, all of whom play important roles in in the novel, as well as a host of minor characters. It is, however, the four friends who remain central to the story, especially Jude and Willem, roommates in college and who remain the closest of the friends. The bulk of Yanagiharaâs novel is told in chronicle order, but as the novel progresses, there are more flashbacks and memories, some of which get repeated with added detail as they surface, most of them revolving around Jude who becomes more and more the novelâs central character.When thinking about tragic characters in prose fiction, no one comes my mind as being more tragic than Jude Fawley from Thomas Hardyâs JUDE THE OBSCURE (1894/1895) which may be the motivation for the authorâs name for her main characterâJude, âthe patron saint of lost causes.â Although readers soon come to the realization Jude is a physically and emotionally scarred individual, Yanagiharaâs revelations about the details of Judeâs history are painfully slow in comingâmirroring the complexity and rawness of those very memories which haunt and torment Jude. They are memories which have shaped, or rather distorted, his life. In one flashback the author reveals twenty-five years in the past, Ana, Jude's now deceased âfirst and only social workerâ warning Jude during a hospital stay, ââ¦you have to talk about these things while theyâre fresh. Or youâll never talk about themâ¦ and itâs going to fester inside you, and youâre always going to think youâre to blame. Youâll be wrong, of course, but youâll always think it.âThere are relatively few highs in Judeâs life and when they occur, the reader is bound to find them tearful moments of joy. The increasingly close friendship between Jude and Willem with both of them at the zenith of their careers is complexâfilled paradoxically with the bounty which human relationships can contain along with enormous peril. Unfortunately, most of Judeâs life is a series of unrelenting, dreadful, terrifying, shattering lows and betrayals accompanied by self-destructive impulses which become worse and worse, adding to a manâs already burdensome childhood, youth, and life-long post-traumatic stress. Judeâs is a portrait of suffering beyond comprehension and the brutal perpetrators of his torments throughout his life are the epitome of unfathomable, monstrous human behavior.Thus, A LITTLE LIFE does not make for easy reading. It is emotionally jolting and at the same time riveting. So vivid are Yanagiharaâs expose of the quartet of characters, the reader becomes one with them, making it a quintet. The authorâs characters are real to life, the dialogue is vivid and genuine, and the quality of the writing as well as the tone of the novel is unswerving. Although Yanagiharaâs central characters meet with sometimes staggering personal and professional successes, there are also failures and tragedies, both past and present, and always a dire cloud which encircles them all, especially Jude. Due to her immense and encompassing narrative skills, readers will eventually brace themselves so that whenever a horrifying revelation is made about Judeâs secret past or his present, there is likely worse to come.A narrative trick Yanagihara pulls a little over a quarter of the way into the novel and again at the half-way point, moving from an omniscient narrator to what clearly is a first person although not readily identifiable narrator, is bound to strike the reader as both curious and possibly even portentous. It is left up to the reader to recognize and interpret for themselves the meaning of the authorâs temporary changes in point of view. She does the same switch near the bookâs conclusion which eventually brings the work to its shocking climax and even more emotionally numbing, traumatic end.Clearly, A LITTLE LIFE is not for everyone. even though the novel is a modern masterpiece of writing and prose fiction and a work which will haunt the reader for a long time. The most resilient reader may very likely find there are times when they simply must close the book and exit the bleakness of the world Yanagihara creates before picking the book up again. Others may discover there are times when they simply want to throw the book across the room. Some readers may find the book impossible to finish because it is so emotionally draining. Regardless of the readerâs reaction to the novel, A LITTLE LIFE is an incredible accomplishment and a work which haunt the reader for a long time.[NOTES: (1) A LITTLE LIFE has recently been declared one of âThe 20 Best Novels of the Decadeâ by Emily Temple for The Literary Hub on December 23, 2019.

"This is a novel that requires patience, commitment, and perseverance. Not just because of its length (720 pages), but, because it doesn't exactly grab you swiftly. It took me almost 300 pages to feel installed in the story, rather than just a visitor hovering outside the narrative. Yanagihara is long-winded, although not generally dull, yet she also, in my opinion, only fully realized one character, Jude St. Francis, the successful but troubled Ivy League-educated lawyer with a tragic, troubled past. The mostly interior story is ostensibly about these four friends who meet in their teens, and their ongoing friendship for over thirty years. But, really, it is a profile of Jude (with some shared traits of the Obscure one).Jude was ritually abused as an orphan, although the author is quite circumspect about the details, which take 2/3 of the novel to completely fill in (and even then, there's always more). However, even before I was enervated by the laboriously slow reveal, the reader ""gets it,""--this isn't exactly new stuff for our topical times, but it always dismays us to hear about disturbed, violent people who abuse children. By the time she filled in the shocking details, I was astonished, yes, but also a bit weary.There's also a lot of repetition of Jude's adult coping behaviors (in ways, almost as horrifying as the abuse)-- but necessary, I suppose, to really be intimate with his ongoing struggles, to demonstrate the limitless loneliness and pain one suffers when life is clouded by shame. But, I admit to some impatience, too. I was straining to believe that everyone was ALWAYS therapeutic with Jude. He was glum and intractable, refusing to talk about his past (with a few people, he revealed bits and pieces)--but, as I said, their ability to be so 110% willing and available for Jude was really too good to be true. Rarely, they lost patience-- carefully manipulated by the author to usually further the story along (and Jude).Jude's three friends, ones he has known since college--Willem, the successful actor, Malcolm, the successful architect, and JB, the successful artist (actually, all the characters in this book are so highly successful as to be almost untouchable, no pun intended), start out as developing characters, and then slip into either straw men and/or saints. Then there is Andy, the virtuous and always available surgeon, and Harold, the law professor with the patience of Job. All these men (with one seeming exception--JB, who makes a few mistakes) are so thoroughly, unerringly, and impossibly pledged to Jude that it eventually strikes a false note. All of these very busy people--world travelers--seem to have drop-everything time and an almost pious forbearance for Jude, the enigmatic one who refuses to reveal his past and his harrowing abuses. There were virtually no female characters--well, Harold's wife, Julia, and Malcolm's, wife, but they were nothing but generic passers-by, even if (like Julia) they played an important role. They were all tools for the character of Jude.If I were to name a second, well-developed character, it would be the setting. No matter how many books are set in New York City, there are as many ways and more to bring it alive. Yanagihara has a sharp eye for living spaces, architecture, color, and art, and in this way, she gave New York its singular charisma. I would also assert that having an architect and an artist as two of Jude's friends allowed her to buttress the book with her eye for these details, which I enjoyed greatly. JB's installations (of course, mostly about Jude or himself, and conveniently about the other friends for later absorption) added shade to the story, but, again, it seemed that everything was for Jude's character.This is a mostly interior novel, which is why I demand either faceted characters or compelling ideas. The author flirts with ideas through the art world but there's nothing inherently philosophical about the novel. Moreover, the author gave all the other characters, except for Jude, short shrift. Willem actually starts out engaging. His childhood was also tragic, but for different reasons. Yet, too soon, Willem turns into a big movie star and his character a cursory device for Jude. Willem is the most saintly of all the characters, an actor who is never self-absorbed, who isn't even aware of his fame when he walks into a room. He's portrayed as way too humble to be organic.Most of the men in this novel made me think of those Seurat paintings, where the people whose faces we never see too well are diminished or faded into the background. Is that what the author intended? I don't think so, because in her debut book, The People in the Trees , she had several well-realized characters. Moreover, in 700+ pages, she includes Jude's friends frequently, but the more they are present, the more absence I felt of their true natures. She also covered the topic of child abuse in both novels, but, in TREES, it's for the reader to ascertain, over the course of the suspenseful story, whether the narrator is reliable or not, and if the child abuse really did take place. In A LITTLE LIFE, we know it took place, and we follow the abused child mostly as an adult.Just a side note: Yanagihara tends to pair abuse with a life of privilege. In The People in the Trees , the alleged abuser is a scholar/scientist. In this second book, the victim of abuse grows to be in the elite 1%. I would like to see her take it down a notch--show how many abused children are stuck in the system or live in the real world as a worker bee, not touched by highbrow living, and too impaired to put together a successful life. Jude, however, is an accomplished pianist with a beautiful voice, is well-read, a superior cook, and is what I would identify as that rare contemporary Renaissance man--but he works as a corporate lawyer 80-100 hours/week, where his troubles seem to melt away on the job.Regardless of the flaws, I stuck with the novel; Jude was so captivating, even in his reticence, that I wanted to see it through. I think Yanagihara could have shaved off a few hundred pages without hurting the narrative, especially as she didn't seem intent on filling out the characters beyond a certain point.At the beginning, there was evidence that there would be nuance regarding race and sexual orientation. A few comments were made at the start, coyly referring to the fact that only Willem is white. Jude was ""undetermined,"" a mix of backgrounds, and Malcolm and JB were black. So why a white man on the cover of the book? Is that supposed to be Willem? That seems disingenuous to me, as the main character, Jude, is not Caucasion. That was just one of the several manipulations that seemed inorganic.Also, there seemed to be little or no controversy about gay issues. Some of the characters were gay or bi-, but they didn't seem to go through any hardships, past or present, with their sexual orientation. It was so smooth that it was glossed over. Parents--proud and accepting, peers--proud and accepting, colleagues--proud and accepting. Nothing in these men's lives stirred any controversy or hardship (unless it has to do with their relationship with Jude)--just success. Even JB's problems were disposed of quickly. But, I suppose if you are in the 1%, being black and gay buys you a ticket from discrimination? These men had a paved avenue, so much more than my black and/or gay friends ever did. However, her prose was always strong, solid, subtle:""...he imagined Jude as a magician whose sole trick was concealment, but every year, he got better and better at it, so that now he only had to bring one wing of the silken cape he wore before his eyes and he would become instantly invisible, even to those who knew him best.""3.5 stars",book
"âAre you happy? he once asked Jude (they must have been drunk).I donât think happiness is for me, Jude had said at last, as if Willem had been offering him a dish he didnât want to eat. But itâs for you, Willem.â ââA Little Lifeâ by Hanya Yanagiharaâ­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸In this story we follow the lives of four friends, Malcom, JB, Willem, and Jude, living in New York over the course of four decades. Through addiction, success and pride they are all tethered by their shared devotion to one of them. Jude St. Francis is a brilliant lawyer, a talented pianist, a generous friend, but deeply troubled and scared. There are secrets from his past that he holds so close, keeping them even from his friends, that slowly unfurl in the most heartbreaking and gut wrenching way.How someone who is so loved, reassured, and supported by the people that surround them can still be convinced that they are unworthy of such love and normalcy is a true testament to how debilitating and damn near irreversible some traumas can be. I cried for Jude, I was livid for Jude, I was in awe and proud of Jude! But I was also frustrated with Jude. I wanted to dive into the pages and try to convince him myself how unimaginably brave and deserving he was of all the good fortune he had found after his dark years. To tell him itâs not his fault. No matter your thoughts on the ending of this book it is undeniable how profound and harrowing itâs story is, such a story leaves an impression on the brain.My only complaints about the book are I truly feel it was too long and too repetitive, as well as the punctuation through me off quite a bit because it lacked in consistency here and there. I also really really wish there had been more of JB and Malcom as the book mostly centers around Jude and Willem.I would say that I do recommend this book, but absolutely NOT to everyone. Please please do not read this book if you are not doing well mentally as the triggers are aplenty.",book
"I finished Hanya Yanagihara's emotionally draining, 'A Little Life', over three months ago and in the time since, I felt I needed to recover from her roller coaster of a novel. Imagine though a roller coaster that is on fire, but has classical music playing on its back row as it dips and ascends into screaming terror and melancholic euphoria.Upon completing this novel, I was fatigued, drained, and spent of my emotions because I have never equally hated and admired a book so much in my literary life. On two occasions while reading, I took a shot of tequila to get through particular sections. Sections where when the tequila did not help, I put the book down because the book's content read like being hit by a Mack truck at full speed. Nothing in this novel is subtle, as a matter of fact, I equate reading it to a jackhammer puncturing hard-baked cement and you the reader is the cement. The storytelling is piercing, with plangent themes that gutted my insides, and it is so visceral that it ostensibly paints Yanagihara to be a sadistic fiend for unleashing a literary work such as this. She's of course not, she's simply a good writer who knows how to bring a heartbreaking story to life.Yes, 'A Little Life' is an agonizing read, but one that was masterfully written, offering all manner of literary rewards. Employing use of a dense, particularized writing style, Yanagihara's prose is architectural, cerebral, and drawn out at a pace that is like molasses rolling up a sand dusted hill. From page one, I found the four protagonists to be engaging, but forebodingly so, where I immediately knew that there will be a lot to unpack in the subsequent pages ahead. Though the novel's setting is contemporary, Yanagihara tells it in an odd but effective flashback mixed with present day style where the context of time is always abstract. Specific dates or years are never used, instead we get descriptors such as ""nine years ago,"" ""on his fifth birthday,"" ""four years after..."" This approach bothered me initially, because it made some of the flashback scenes less textural. But Yanagihara is such a good writer, she made the technique work, as it became tolerable as I read on. Again, nothing in this novel is subtle or plain, but despite the elaborately detailed descriptions, which I admired, the novel is readable. Although, I think some readers may find it to be plodding.For me, I think one of Yanagihara's strength as a writer is her ability to flesh out characters as if they were filigree, branching them out far and wide, but characters that have a centered, yet deeply flawed souls. As well written as each of the characterizations are here, I admit that I dislike every one of them. The four protagonists - Jude, Willem, Jean-Baptist, and Malcolm, plus two major secondary ones, Andy, and Harold - all made my emotions seesaw from vexation to sympathy, but mostly vexation. Jude, the center of the novel's story, is especially maddening. He is a self imposed martyr, at times grating, and is in constant need of attention, attention that is wanted or not. Yet, I couldn't help but be heartbroken for him due to his disquieting childhood and unenviable lot in life.Another source of frustration was that 'A Little Life' has in my opinion, an uncomfortable air of incestuous camaraderie between the six protagonists, a bothersome co-dependency that drove me up the wall. Everyone in Jude's life - Willem, Jean-Baptist, Malcolm, Andy, and Harold, individually and collectively coddle him to such an extant that it borders on criminal. I was bothered that each of these characters allowed their hubris and selfishness to take precedence over the necessary tough love that Jude needed. The enabling and coddling became reductive, and peeved me so badly that I yelled out at my book several times. Still, despite my irritation at the imbecilic actions of the characters, I couldn't help but regress into pity and gut-wrenching grief for each of their lives. Eventually, my dislike of the characters became irrelevant, as I don't think characters have to be likable in order to be effective. At any given time, I was mad at each of them, but in their frustrating behavior, they made me think long and hard about human frailty.Despite my frustrations, and even at 720 densely packed pages, 'A Little Life' is a worthy read. Make no mistake, as it did me, this is a novel that will peel your insides and likely wreck you. There were moments where I could only read certain chapters in short spurts, with breaks between paragraphs because the content is so unsettling. Nevertheless, I read it all, because even though this is a fictional story, I can't help but think that it is the life that some unfortunate souls have lived, and or are living right now.I highly recommend 'A Little Life', but again be warned, the content is visceral, EXCRUCIATING, and unrelenting. The depravity and evil that Yanagihara has showcased in these pages is unreal, and is unlike any I've ever read. As you progress though the novel, prepare yourself before reading pages 323-340, 392-403, 417-423. The entire book is not easy to get through, but these pages are especially ungodly. I don't care who you are or how strong you are, I think this book is one that will wreck most. I give it 4.75 stars out of 5 for the writing, the themes, and the fleshed out characterizations, even though the novel as a whole is positively diabolical.",book

Good thing there are other Eric Carle books for a little variety here and there!I do recommend the board book version for kids in this age range, since they like to experience everything in an up close and personal way and you want them to love books and interact with them.",book
I had this book as a child and just purchased it for my 16 month old. It is now his new favorite book and he brings it to me to read it to him constantly. Classic Eric Carle book and even better as a board book as my little one often tries to rip pages off of regular paper books.,book
I ordered this for my grandchildren ages 6 and 3. I plan to give it them next month but I know they will enjoy it. I enjoyed reading it! This is a story I never knew of who first created the huge balloons in Macyâs Thanksgiving Day parade. The story is interesting and the illustrations are beautiful!,book
I purchased this book to read to my class of third graders right before Thanksgiving break. The book was beautifully illustrated and interested. I loved the factual information it provided. I paired it with some YouTube videos about the Macyâs Thanksgiving Parade. This was a perfect supplement read aloud for a fun annual American tradition.,book
This is a great book! Itâs really good for lessons & it is good quality as a hard back,book
This book is a must have. I use it every year during the holiday season. I teach 4th grade and they love it. There are also so many activity ideas all online.,book
"If you have ever watched the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, you need to read this book. I dare say you will enjoy it as much as the children in your life. It was so touching to learn the details of the man responsible for the balloons--his childhood, his history before joining the Macy's team, and his accomplishments during his long tenure with Macy's. What remarkable creativity and problem-solving skills he had! The illustrations for the book could not be better suited to the story and are deserving of a celebration of their own. No purchasing regrets here!",book
"This is a great book as a read aloud for third and fourth graders. In addition, they learn all about the historical aspects of the Macyâs Day Parade and the enormous balloons. Many activities can be used from this story.",book
"If you are a fan of the Macy's thanksgiving day parade, you'll be a fan of this book! It tells how the parade came to be, and the story behind who created it. The illustrations are wonderful too. My son and husband love watching the parade together each year and they loved reading this book together this year.",book
I received it as a gift and then bought it for my grandchildren. Such a fun book and a true story!,book
"I read this with my students the week before Thanksgiving, and they loved it. It has great lessons in perseverance and creativity, but they loved that it was about the invention of balloons used in the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade!",book
The book came in perfect condition. The story is such an original one to use in the classroom for Thanksgiving week activities. We decorated our own balloons and had a parade through our school after.,book
"The Four Agreements by Don Miguel Ruiz & The Fifth Agreement by Don Miguel Ruiz and Don Jose Ruiz I decided to âreviewâ or âsummarizeâ these books together because the Fifth Agreement is very much a continuation of the first book, and in fact reiterates much of the earlier text. Both are based on the philosophy of the Toltec, ancient people of southern Mexico who were known as women and men of knowledge. Before delving into the books, I should acknowledge that I found then somewhat difficult. Although I have read a great many of what I would call âspiritualâ books and wrings in the recent years, these readings, although similar, were a bit more difficult to fully digest. The author at times anticipates such problems on the part of the reader, and is indeed accurate in that regard. The Toltecs were not a race or tribe, or nation, but scientists and artists formed to explore and conserve the spiritual knowledge and practices of the âancient onesâ. They came together as masters (naguals) and students at Teotihuacan, the ancient city of pyramids outside Mexico City and known as the place where âMan Becomes Godâ. The Toltec recognize that some 3000 years ago a human studying to be a medicine man woke to the realization that everything is made of light and that all that exists is one living being, and that light is the messenger of life because it is alive and contains all information. He called the stars the tonal and the light between the stars the nagual, and knew what created the harmony between the two is life or intent. He saw himself in everything- in every human, every animal, every tree, in the water, the clouds and the earth. As I read the book, this seeing, this realization, is the truth, is pure love and pure light. It is this truth that we much search for. But why must we search if such truth is everywhere? We must search because we have lost the truth. When we are born devoid of language, we are the truthâour presence is a miracle. We feel and see what is, without interpretation or judgment. But, as we grow, we are what the author calls âdomesticatedâ, just as animals are. The truth that we feel is replaced by symbols-words- that are mere illusions, that are opinions grafted onto objects and feelings. We apply our attentionâ the ability to discriminate and focus only on what we want to perceive- on these symbols. As children we believe what adults say, especially our parents, and our world becomes a dream, a reality built on symbols from others, not the silent feelings and observations that we experienced as infants. And this learned reality-our dream- tells us how to behave in society; what to believe and not believe; what is acceptable and not acceptable; what is good and bad; right and wrong; beautiful and ugly. We are imperfect because we do not measure up to an image of perfection that has been imposed on us by others. And we accept such law and structure by a system of reward for doing what is ârightâ and punishment for doing what is âwrongâ. This acceptance reflects a multitude of agreements we have made with our world. We are judged and punished and then punish ourselves for bad behavior. We become victims who carry guilt for such failures, and are punished again and again whenever we are reminded, or remind ourselves of such failures. We live in a dream ruled by fear and filled with emotions of anger, jealousy, envy and hate. We must be right and prove others wrong. Our mind and our world become a fogâa mitote- a dream where a thousand people talk at once and no one understands. The author feels that, as a result, we are living in a dream of hell. We then search for the truth, for a way out of this hell. And yet, the truth is already within us, we donât have to search, we just have to uncover what is part of us already, as it was when we were born. To escape our dream of hell, we must break the old agreements that are fear based and reclaim our personal power. We must create a new dream, our own dream- our personal dream of heaven. The author suggests four basic agreements that you must make with yourself to reclaim your own power and find a heaven on earth, a life of joy and fulfillment. The First Agreement- Be Impeccable With Your Word. The author feels that this first agreement is the most important and powerful. I noticed a few things about the wording. First, he uses the singular âwordâ, rather than âwordsâ. I think perhaps this is in deference to the use of such term in the bible where John, speaking of creation, says âIn the beginning was the word, and the word was God, and the word is God.â Through words you express your creative power. But he obviously means the plural, that your use of language must be impeccable. The use of âimpeccableâ is also interesting. Our common definition of âimpeccableâ is faultless or flawless. But it also means incapable of sin or without sin. It is this meaning that the author employs. He feels that a sin is anything that goes against yourself, and being impeccable is not gong against yourself, taking responsibility for your actions, but not judging or blaming. He says that if one loves him or her self, then he or she will express that love in interaction with others, and will thus be impeccable with the word, because such word, such action, will produce a like reaction. He contrasts words coming from love with those coming from what he calls black magic. He feels that gossip is the worst form of black magic, for it is judgmental language about others, even those we do not know. It is emotional poison that we teach to our children and friends and loved ones through our use of such criticism. The word is too often used to blame, to criticize, to find guilt and destroy. He gives the simple example of a child being told by her mother to shut up her singing because her voice was âuglyâ. The child obviously agreed with her mother, and thus made an agreement with herself not to sing any more. These are the type of agreements that we make in life that are harmful and destructive, that lead us into our dream of hell. Instead, when you are impeccable with your words, they are no longer fertile ground for gossip and criticism, but for love. And as you use such words, first by expressing love for yourself, you break all the many agreements that make you suffer, and begin to build your own dream of heaven on earth. I donât read âimpeccableâ to mean absolutely honest, for there are times when being absolutely honest could be counter to your words coming from love. The Second Agreement- Donât Take Anything Personally. This is much easier said than done and I also think that the author assumes that one is practicing impeccability in their word before adopting this. He basically feels that people take things personally because we assume that things said are truly about us and that we are prone to believe them. In fact, he feels that people do not do or say things because of us, but because of themselves. Also, whatever they do or say is a product of their own belief system, of their own personal dream. Thus, what they may think about me is not about me but is about them. Instead of accepting this, we resort to the need to be right, and show the other wrong, so we magnify the power of their words or deeds. If instead we always act from a sense of loveâthe impeccability of our word- then if someone is mad at me, then I know that he or she is mad at him or herself and I am just the excuse for their anger. When you stop taking things personally you can keep your heart open and not be harmed. You will not need to trust in what others do or say, but only trust yourself to make responsible choices. And you must remember that neither praise nor criticism is to be taken personally because it is not about you, but the speaker. As I said at the outset of my comments on this Agreement, I think, in discussing this Agreement, that the author assumes that he is impeccable with his word. If not, then how could he say that when someone gets mad at you they are mad at themselves? This may still be true even if you were not using your word impeccably, but it would be harder to accept, especially since, in his discussion of impeccability, the author says that one must take responsibility for his actions. Wouldnât this mean that when we are less than impeccable that we must accept some consequence, but not punish our self endlessly? Couldnât someoneâs anger be about us if our word was less than impeccable, but instead filled with the black magic mentioned by the author? I raise these questions in my mind because at times, as I read through this, it sounds as if one can âget a passâ for less than sterling behavior because he need not take others reactions personally. I donât think this is the authorâs message, but it could be read into some of the philosophy. The Third Agreement- Donât Make Assumptions The author starts off his discussion with this statement: âAll the sadness and drama you have lived in your life was rooted in making assumptions and taking things personally.âAlthough I would question the use of the word âallâ (I have a hard time with such broad statements like âallâ or ânoneâ orâalwaysâ or âneverâ), I basically agree with his statement, especially as it concerns emotional reaction to others. (True sadness from the passing of a child or similar âobjectiveâ tragedy is hard to relate to assumptions or taking things personally) I have found that people often assume my meaning, and sometimes take offense at something that was never intended to harm. They probably misunderstood, but, as the author notes, were afraid to ask for clarification and therefore filled in any uncertainty with an assumption. I donât know exactly why we are afraid to ask for clarification, maybe it roots back to those days when we were reluctant to ask questions in school. Maybe it a fear of being wrong, even if it is a subjective response to another. I donât know why we do such things, but know that we do, and that it causes great and unnecessary pain. I think these two agreements about taking things personally and making assumptions are really part of a self centeredness that âit is all about meâ. We often tell people, âitâs not always about youâ , but such words are almost in jest. In fact it is really important to realize that it isnât always about you, especially when the assumptions made generally do assume so and lead to taking things personally. Not making assumptions would seem to be one of the easier agreements to live up to, as it only involves a little bit of inquiry. But, like any change, it requires practice. The author just suggests that you âMake sure the communication is clear. If you donât understand, ask. Have the courage to ask questions until you are clear as you can be, and even then do not assume that you know all there is to know about a given situation.âGood advice. The Fourth Agreement is About the Action of the First Three- Always do Your Best. The author stresses always doing your best, but knowing that your best will vary from one moment to the next depending on how you feel, etc. But, whatever your state, you must always do your bestâneither less nor more. Trying to do more than your best will cause you to spend unneeded energy and, in the end, your best will not be good enough. You must be motivated to do your best not by some expected reward, but by the love of what you are doing. Doing your best will help with the other three agreements and it will also make you feel better even if you suffer failures in the other three. If you keep trying to do your best you will become a master of transformation-practice will make you the master. Always doing your best requires a great deal of effort. If you break an agreement, then you must be willing to begin again the next day and try your best to keep such agreement. In reading the authorâs comments on this fourth agreement I am unsure whether he is relating âdoing your bestâ to life in general or to the application of the other three agreements. I see his book as being primarily focused on reaching an internal contentment and happiness, not on navigating oneâs way through the world at large. Admittedly, such inner contentment may well supply the path to successfully living in this rather complex world. I just find a bit of a contrast between the focus of this work and something like âFalling Upwardâ by Richard Rohr where he acknowledges the need to survive in the competitive world as a means of gaining some level of confidence before, in the second half of life, we are able to discard much of the baggage of the first half and seek out a more personal and spiritual contentment. Of course, this may be my misreading of both books, but, thatâs what an opinion is all about. I also see a basic similarity between the two, and among other spiritual pieces that I have read. All see Western culture as imposing and espousing a very competitive, win/loose guilt ridden mentality. Such mentality may or may not be necessary for the struggles that we face, but, all my readings seem to agree that at some point our thoughts need to focus on attaining a more peaceful and inclusive level of spiritual contentment. This is the truth that the Four Agreements challenge you to seek. The Fifth Agreement - Be Skeptical but Learn to Listen As the author has pointed out, we learn from symbols, and these symbols do not represent the truth, which is present in everything. Symbols are peopleâs interpretations of objects and feelings and are not the truth, but are often lies. Thus, it is important to be skeptical, but he adds that you must then listen. When you listen carefully to others you can then understand the symbols that they are using and understand their storyâtheir dream. Your communication improves and you can then see if what another is saying has relevance to you. You do not have to believe their story, for it is only symbols. Similarly, you do not have to believe your own story, for it is just made from your symbols. Neither story is the truth, the truth simply is, whether you believe in it or not. It doesnât need you to believe, for it simply is. When you listen you donât have to form or express opinions, you merely need to listen. By merely listening you show respect for the other personâs dream, for the reality he or she has created. The author sees all persons essentially as artists who create their worlds, and they must be respected as such. When we listen and share our stories, we try to understand them and make them part or our stories if we so desireâor not. If you gain control over your symbols then what is left is the real you, and the real you, not your symbols, makes your choices. In trying to summarize what the author is saying I find myself struggling at times to get to the crux of his message. I think that perhaps by expanding his work to this Fifth Agreement he intends to open the door to spread the wisdom of the Four Agreements to others. The first Four Agreements taught us that out symbols are not the truth, and that many of these symbolsâour entire symbology as he calls it- are lies that lead us to blame and shame and guilt, to a living hell. The Four Agreements help us escape this personal hell, but perhaps there is more that we need to do. The author expands his discussion to outline the different stages that we go through as we try to reach our heaven on earth. He calls these steps âattentionsâ. The first Attention is the dream we create when we first use our attention to absorb the various symbols that we learn, and we then believe such symbols represent knowledge and our reality. He calls this first attention the ordinary dream of humans or the dream of the victims. It is a dream of victims because we are the victims of the false symbols which form our reality. And our reality is not about us, it is a mirror reflecting what others expect of us and for us. You must be freed of such reality and discover your true self. Then we reach a stage where we realize that our dream is a lie and we use the attention a second time to try to change our dream and create a new one. This is the Second Dream of Attention or the Dream of the Warriors because we now declare war against all the lies in our knowledge. It is a war against that part of our mind that makes all the choices that guide us into our personal hell. Itâs a war between out true self and our belief systemâwhat the author calls the tyrant or the big judge. In this battle we fight to throw off the belief system that causes us to repeatedly punish ourselves for past âwrongsâ- the system that brings up past thoughts and punishes us over and over again. The author notes that âHumans are the only animals on earth who punish themselves a thousand times or more for the same mistake, and who punish everybody else a thousand times or more for the same mistake.âHe instead postulates that true justice is to pay once for every mistake. As a warrior, one fights to find his true self. The author then notes that the dream of the second attention ends when something very important happens, something called the last judgment. This is the last time that we judge ourselves or anyone else. Itâs the day we accept ourselves just the way we are and everyone else just the way they are. When the day of our last judgment comes, the war in our head is over and the dream of the third attention begins. We move from the dream of the warriors to the dream of the masters. This is a dream of truth and respect and joy. It is that point where we come back to our real state, our divine self, where we fell a communion of love with everything in existence. When we learn that the symbols are not the truth, then we are left to simply enjoy life, as we did before the symbols ruled us. We experience what he refers to as a resurrection, and it allows us to be wild and free like a child, except that we have freedom with wisdom instead of innocence. At this point we donât need to judge ourselves or others, we donât need to be right, nor prove others wrong, and we can express love with no shame or justification and walk in the world with our heart completely open. This is the goalâ a life of joy. These books express a philosophy couched in rather mystical termsâin dreams and symbols, attention and awareness. But its message seems quite similar to other philosophies and much that is discussed in the current realm of what I will call a new spirituality. It suggests a path to find our spiritual connectedness to all of the world around us, a realization that we are each a part of everything, and that everything is a part of us. It reveals truth as not as description or a concept, but something that simply is. As the author points out, the physical nature of a chair is truthâits name is just a symbol, a symbol that can take a myriad of forms. I think he feels that a concept like goodness is also a truth that is intrinsically recognized and internal, and not a product of a value system that is imposed on us by others. As is love, and beauty. As do many others, he lauds the innocence of childhood, a time when the truth is real before we become âdomesticatedâ. He doesnât condemn such domestication, he just says that it is because all of us have been indoctrinated and pass that knowledge on. But, at least to me, he doesnât recognize such conditioning as being a necessary part of that portion of our lives when we must learn to cope in our world. I think that this is the message that Richard Rohr sends in âFalling Upwardâ. I can easily be misreading both, but, so be it. The striking thing, as I read numerous books and other writings, and watch speeches, is the basic consistency in the message of oneness and the need to abandon, at least temporarily, much of what we have âlearnedâ in order to open our minds, or perhaps clear our minds, so that we can receive the gift of interconnectedness. Whether this is termed as experiencing heaven, or nirvana, or âonenessâ is of no consequence. These are just names for a realization of our humble and insignificant position in a broader, more accepting, and more loving world than most of us witness day to day.",book
"I should start off by stating my background. I am an undergrad student of philosophy and linguistics, a branch of the humanities. I also deeply love this series of books because of its obviousness and simplicity. It has personally helped me triumph over many, many challenges. This is why I decided to write a review here.There is a huge tradition of skepticism in linguistics, especially about how language is used in various cultures to create belief systems. A belief system is basically a set of instructions inside your brain based on language. These instructions help you navigate the stressful world around you so you can survive. We are psychologically wired to think our belief systems are accurate and experience deep stress if we find them to be inaccurate.The trouble is, our belief systems are ALWAYS inaccurate. Yes, I used the word ""always"" for a reason.Without going deeply into the study of philosophy and linguistics, I will give you an overview here:Philosophy - When you study philosophy, you study belief systems about how the world works and explore important questions like ""is there a God?"" or ""What is consciousness."" You may not be surprised to find out that philosophy majors have not come up with answers to these questions because there is always a case where we are going to be wrong or have a counter argument. Much of the study of philosophy is the collection of vocabulary words to describe beliefs. They even have a mathematical component called propositional logic, where one takes sentences and reduces them to symbols and creates ""proofs"" but even prop-logic is under fire from academics for its complete inability to predict anything. In other words, it isn't the answer either.Linguistics - When you study words and language, you realize that all our beliefs are based on language and this language can never ""touch reality"" in that language is just an arbitrary description of reality, posing as real. I believe Miguel Ruiz must have taken a linguistics course as well--as his first agreement attests to the power of language. The four agreements pulls heavily from Saussure and Derrida. Both Saussure and Derrida (and many, many others) did work on how we form ideas in our heads based on language. The gist is this: we have something called a ""symbol"" in our brain which is composed of two parts: the word and the visual representation of the object (look up semiotics for further detail). These symbols are in our mind and work together to form meaning, then belief. The unfortunate thing is that they are entirely made up. It isn't real. Our ideas of it aren't real.If you really want a deeper understanding on how linguistics has saturated our belief systems I recommend reading some of their academic essays or get Rivkin and Ryan's literary theory books. They are excellent and will take you further down the rabbit hole. Most of the essays are dense but worth the effort!To simplify: scientists and academics in the millions have tried and tried and tried to find ""the true belief"" for thousands, maybe tens of thousands of years and we have not yet arrived at any truth. Because of domestication, we think other people have it, but they don't! ""Truth"" is defined as that which has the most predictive power. So far, mathematics, geometry, and physics has the most predictive power. Our belief systems simply do not.So any beliefs about yourself can be true and they can also be false. We can't know. So why not pick something positive? If no one knows anything, then how can you even know anything?But you don't need to study this yourself. All you have to do is think back to your past self, let's say ten years ago. Did that person have a belief system that you now consider to be faulty? How is that possible? What about your future self? Will that person believe you have a faulty belief system? Probably! How is this possible? How can you be SO WRONG? Is it because you ""haven't learned?"" I highly doubt it!But we have to be right! We ARE RIGHT! At least we think we might be . . . maybe?The need to be right is so ingrained within us that we create a huge drama when someone contradicts our beliefs. We end relationships over it! We storm out! We write angry twitter updates.HOW THIS BOOK HAS PERSONALLY HELPED ME:- No one person's opinion will ever again have the power to limit what I can do, even if this person is an authority figure- No one group's opinion will ever again have the power to limit what I can do- No one has a clear idea of who or what I am, not even me!- When people talk, they are telling stories. I don't have to argue. I don't have to fight. I simply have to listen. WOW!- I cannot comprehend another person's dream. I can't mind read. I can't assume. I know nothing of their inner workings.- Even scary, aggressive people are just telling stories.- I no longer have to feel ashamed about who I am or what I've done or where I'm going. It's not my job to assign a story to my life, or a judgment.- I no longer have to pretend to be something or hustle to gain love. I just need to love who is willing to love back. It's so simple.- I take all gurus, religions, indictments and gossip with quite a high level of benevolent skepticism, which allows me to be free from the fear that goes along with these stories.- I don't take myself as seriously as I used to.Probably the most valuable of all . . .- I have a deep compassion for all people. We are all just stuck here together, trying our hardest and doing our best. I don't have to hate someone because their best wasn't up to some story I tell myself. I don't' have to insist they believe in my story. I can just smile and listen and do what I can.",book
"The book has the boldest of aspirations, attempting to be in the peer set of sacred religious foundations such as The Bible. The author believes we create our own hell and, through practicing the ""agreements"" in this book, could instead create our own heaven. The core idea of reframing your mental state is well studied and backed up by science, but the degree to which these agreements fulfill such lofty ambitious is an open question. My take is that there's some wisdom that anyone could benefit from, but there's a cloud of poor editing the reader must pass through to access it.""The dream you are living is your creation. It is your perception of reality that you can change at any time. You have the power to create hell, and you have the power to create heaven.""Agreement 1: Be Impeccable With Your WordSimilar to the Buddhist eightfold path ""right speech"". They mean speech that doesn't go against yourself. This is both negative self-talk as well as unkind words towards others, because that comes back against us* If I see you in the street and I call you stupid, it appears that Iâm using the word against you. But really Iâm using my word against myself, because youâre going to hate me for this, and your hating me is not good for me.* Using the analogy of the human mind as a computer, gossip can be compared to a computer virus. A computer virus is a piece of computer language written in the same language all the other codes are written in, but with a harmful intent. This code is inserted into the program of your computer when you least expect it and most of the time without your awareness. After this code has been introduced, your computer doesnât work quite right.* Impeccability of the word will also give you immunity from anyone putting a negative spell on you. You will only receive a negative idea if your mind is fertile ground for that idea.Agreement 2: Don't Take Anything Personally.Like David Foster Wallace's ""This is water"", we have a rather selfish view that the world revolves around us. Instead, we must love ourselves and refuse to take the ""poison"" others may inflict towards us.* Even when a situation seems so personal, even if others insult you directly, it has nothing to do with you. What they say, what they do, and the opinions they give are according to the agreements they have in their own minds.* Even the opinions you have about yourself are not necessarily true; therefore, you donât need to take whatever you hear in your own mind personally.* All the sadness and drama you have lived in your life was rooted in making assumptions and taking things personally.Agreement 3: Don't Make Assumptions.We view the actions of others through a filter. Instead, we can practice mindfulness and accept things as they are without associating baggage.* We make assumptions about what others are doing or thinking â we take it personally â then we blame them and react by sending emotional poison with our word.* We only see what we want to see, and hear what we want to hear. We donât perceive things the way they are.Agreement 4: Always Do Your Best.In every moment, give it your best. Even the seemingly inconsequential you now give your all. But note this is not about perfection, we are human and can accept our actions as long as we try our best.* When you overdo, you deplete your body and go against yourself, and it will take you longer to accomplish your goal. But if you do less than your best, you subject yourself to frustrations, self-judgment, guilt, and regrets.* If you donât judge yourself there is no way you are going to suffer from guilt, blame, and self-punishment.* When you always do your best, you take action. Doing your best is taking the action because you love it, not because youâre expecting a reward.* When you do your best you learn to accept yourself. But you have to be aware and learn from your mistakes. Learning from your mistakes means you practice, look honestly at the results, and keep practicing.* You do your best because you want to do it, not because you have to do it, not because you are trying to please* I make everything a ritual, and I always do my best. Taking a shower is a ritual for me, and with that action I tell my body how much I love it.Quotes that provide a summary of the author's views* The best way to say, âThank you, God,â is by letting go of the past and living in the present moment, right here and now. Whatever life takes away from you, let it go.* The real you is still a little child who never grew up. Sometimes that little child comes out when you are having fun or playing, when you feel happy, when you are painting, or writing poetry, or playing the piano, or expressing yourself in some way. These are the happiest moments of your life â when the real you comes out, when you donât care about the past and you donât worry about the future.* Develop awareness of all the self-limiting, fear-based beliefs that make you unhappy.* You achieve the Mastery of Transformation by changing the fear-based agreements that make you suffer, and reprogramming your own mind, in your own way.* Going to the core of those agreements is what I call going into the desert. When you go into the desert you meet your demons face-to-face. After coming out of the desert, all those demons become angels.* Happiness is a choice, and so is suffering.",book
"I really enjoyed this book. I've read it multiple times and have decided to try and follow the suggestions to help my life be better. In fact, I took these four agreements and came up with six of mine own - which I'm now using as I have found them and my studies to be conducive to becoming a happier human being.The style of the book can be difficult for some people I suspect, but I found I was easily able to cut through to the meanings as they apply in our modern world. As a philosophy for life, these are by no means bad agreements!",book
"I recently picked up ""The Four Agreements"" by Don Miguel Ruiz, and I must say it has had a profound impact on my life. This book is an insightful gem that serves as a guide to living one's best life, filled with authenticity and personal freedom.Ruiz presents four simple but powerful principles that, when embraced and practiced, can transform the way we perceive ourselves and interact with others. The agreements are:Be impeccable with your word: This agreement emphasizes the importance of speaking with integrity and using our words to spread positivity, love, and truth. It made me realize the immense impact our words can have on ourselves and those around us.Don't take anything personally: This agreement reminded me that other people's opinions and actions are not a reflection of my worth. It taught me to detach from the opinions of others, freeing me from unnecessary suffering and allowing me to find inner peace.Don't make assumptions: This agreement encourages us to seek clarity and communicate openly instead of assuming things about others. It helped me realize how often misunderstandings and conflicts arise from making assumptions, and it inspired me to approach situations with curiosity and open-mindedness.Always do your best: This agreement is about giving our best effort in everything we do, regardless of the outcome. It taught me that true success is measured by the extent of our personal growth and the dedication we put into our endeavors.""The Four Agreements"" is written in a simple and accessible manner, making it easy to absorb and apply the teachings to daily life. Don Miguel Ruiz's wisdom shines through every page, and his storytelling style brings the concepts to life. I found myself engrossed in his words, feeling as though he was speaking directly to me, guiding me towards a more fulfilling existence.What I appreciate most about this book is its universal applicability. The principles outlined can be embraced by people from all walks of life, regardless of religious or cultural background. It has given me a new perspective on how to navigate relationships, set boundaries, and cultivate self-love.If you're seeking personal growth, greater self-awareness, and a path to living your best life, I wholeheartedly recommend ""The Four Agreements."" It's a transformative read that will leave you feeling empowered, inspired, and ready to make positive changes in your life.",book
"I wholeheartedly recommend Miguel Ruiz's book. It's undoubtedly one of my favorite works by this author. Within its pages, it delves into the significance of not taking things personally, always striving to do your best, liberating oneself from personal constraints, and remarkably, it's remarkably easy to comprehend. I particularly admire the illustrations and instances presented within the book.My initial encounter with this book was during my time as an intern at a drug recovery center. Therapists in group sessions would read excerpts from the book for discussions, and it served as a tremendous source of guidance for individuals in recovery, enabling them to reclaim their inner strength and foster positive self-improvement.I felt compelled to acquire a copy for myself, and I even bought one for my sister. Both of us have since embraced its teachings fervently, and as a result of incorporating Toltec wisdom into our lives, we have experienced a significant improvement in our overall well-being.HIGHLY RECOMMEND",book
This book is amazing and it was a life changer for me. I truly believe the world would be in a much better state if we all understood and practiced the knowledge that was given in this book! LITERALLY WORDS TO LIVE BY!!!,book
This is good book. Reinforces the importance of not to take things personally in life. most people that treat you negatively have their own issues that they need to be deal with.,book
"The first time I read this book, it changed my life. I have since bought and gifted it to a handful of people, and I have only heard good things from anyone who has mentioned reading it. It has simple enough concepts, has encapturing stories, is short enough for even the non-avid readers and is phenomenal. Like I said, it changed my life. Maybe it will change yours.",book
"I loved this book so I purchased 2 other books by this author. This book did not smell but unfortunately the other 2 did smell to I returned one book and after taking to Amazon I did an exchange for the second book. I hoping the book exchange will not smell. I love this author. Wish more people would be aware of his teachings,",book
"I donât do well with peer pressure and with all the hype around the bookâ¦well I gave in. This book 100% lives up to its well-deserved hype. Once I started this one I could not put it down. This was my first Freida book and Iâve now read 3 others. I can say she is an immediate buy author for me. I immediately read the next book as well. I just had to continue Millieâs story.Millie has recently gotten out of prison and is on the hunt for a job. She lives in her car, tired of the bar, and canât even get a job in fast food. She's in her 20s and is gorgeous, but wears glasses and clothes to lessen her appeal, so others don't think sheâs too pretty to work there. She interviews with Nina Winchester for a job as their housemaid and live-in nanny. Nina is a stay at home wife/mom, seems to only dress in white, slightly overweight, and appears to be very sophisticated.Ninaâs daughter is a spoiled brat who is only dressed in fancy baby doll type dresses. From the second Millie meets her she senses something is off with her. Nina is emotionally unstable and has lots of mood swings and seems to always find ways to insult Millie. Millie is forced to put on a happy face and play nice with her and the daughter so she can get a good reference. She doesnât want to live in her car again and violate her parole. And she definitely doesn't want to go back to prison.Then we have Andrew Winchester. He makes a lot of money, is so very handsome, and seems to be a wonderful father and husband. Millie canât stop herself from fantasizing about him. He seems perfect in every way to her and cannot understand why Nina isnât over the moon about him.Millie ends up having to live in the attic; in a tiny room. There is a small window that is painted shut and the lock is on the other side of the door. The door just so happens to get stuck a lot.And finally we have Enzo. Heâs Italian and allegedly does not speak English, but he is VERY attractive. Enzo tries to warn Millie and reveals some of Ninaâs secrets. That is when she realizes this job may put her life in danger, but she needs it and she thinks it cannot possibly be worse than going back to prison.",book
"First let me say this was soo good!! I definitely ate this book upâ¦ I prob would have finished reading it sooner but you know work calls. If you loved reading Verity by Colleen Hoover then this book is definitely for you!! I love a good thriller and this one did not disappoint. Some of the twist and turns I saw coming tho.. like this perfect husband who is always dressed in a suit and not a single hair on his head out of place like come on thatâs not suspicious. I donât understand why Nina and Millie were so quick to be all in with this man, they knew nothing about him.. and then look what he did to them smh. I read online that this got picked up for aMovie and I canât wait to see who they cast as these characters!! I canât wait to read the next book.",book
"Okay so I liked it but didn't love it. It was fast paced and interesting. Millie was not my favorite character, she was very obviously one of those main characters that has to make all the wrong decisions for the plot to move. That's said by about 30% I figured out the twist. I was not in the least surprised when things went down the way they did. I wasn't exactly disappointed with the ending but I was hoping to have a few expectations subverted. I mean maybe I'm just too disconnected from reading tons of dark messed up stuff but really the whole epic conclusion felt lackluster. I was out for blood and I feel the author only showed me a papercut. Maybe I'm the problem. I did like the writing style and Nina's POV was honestly super refreshing even if I wasn't surprised by the hidden narrative. I don't know if I'll read the next book yet but it's on my radar for sure.",book
I got this book on a recommendation from my mom and her neighbor and the o Ly regret I have is that I could not set this book down once I picked it up. Read the first book in four days (with interruptions - darn responsibilities!) as I was nearing the last 10 chapters I ordered the second book in the series thinking it would arrive as I was finishing the first bookâ¦ I could not have been more wrong because I ended up finishing the first book that day and had to wait a whole (traumatizing) 24 hours till book two was delivered! It was agony having to wait till the next day when all I could think of was getting book two! Do yourself a favor and just buy book 1 & 2 at the same time. Now I have to wait till JUNE to get the 3rd book in the series - this is going to be a traumatizing waitâ¦,book
"I don't have anything bad to say about this book. I loved every second, every page, every chapter, EVERYTHING.It was SO entertaining to read. I found myself so immersed in the story that I became upset when I was interrupted. I've also been recommending it to anyone who would listen to me. Like, that's how much I enjoyed reading this book.I found myself empathizing so much with some of the characters and their struggles and that just makes me love this book even more.It does talk about abuse, so read the trigger warnings",book
"**SPOILERS**Iâm in awe at how Freida kept me on my toes through the entire story! In the beginning, I truly did hate Nina for all the psychological torture she was inflicting on to Millie and rooting for MillDrew to become a couple. I expected there to be some further torture from afar from Nina. Wild how this was NOT the ending at all. Nor the story to be told. Turning the extraordinary husband into the true monster and discovering it was learned behavior all along from Evelynâ¦ I canât imagine what discipline she did to Cece when they were alone. The entire thing has still left me feeling, and then for Mille to be highly recommended to another household by Nina. I wonder how Millie will handle him nextâ¦",book
"Four out of five stars is a solid positive review for me. This was a good book and I really enjoyed the storyline. It kept me intrigued throughout, and I wanted to keep finishing chapter after chapter. The author did a great job of adding some twists and turns that I was not expecting. I felt like both of the female characters had both a good and bad side, and I liked how that unraveled through the book. Read this one.",book
I've just discovered Freida's books. Ill never get any sleep or housework done again. Many books describe their stories as getting hooked on the first page. I want to go from the first page to the last just to get to the ending. Not cheating though. The Housemaid had so many twist and turns it was hard to keep up with the action. Can't miss with this story or any by this author. Yes I have already recommended this book to my sisters.,book
I had this book on my shopping list for a while. I finally ordered it and read it in two days which is very fast for me. So many twists and turns. I enjoyed every page. Iâve already ordered three more books from the same author. I started the second Housekeeper book this afternoon. Iâm so excited to of found an author I enjoy so much. Iâm sure Iâll order more of her books when I finish these three. Happy Reading!,book
The only issue I had with this book was the fact that I couldnât put it down for anything. This book caught my full attention on page 1 and kept my attention to the very end. Be prepared for a fantastic story that will have you so engrossed in its characters that youâll be tempted to lock yourself in a room to avoid anyone interrupting you from reading this book!,book
"David Brooks is good at both reporting and synthesizing best current thinking. Here, in this new book, importantly, he is driven also by his own learning. I think of him as a reflective practitioner. A fellow traveler. This is a good book, not a great book. A 5 star rating, however, for cleat intent and effort. This is a âbig tentâ book full of breadcrumbs of learning and insight. A book that will be relevant and helpful for many. The best chapters go deep. A single topic unpacked like empathy. The chapters in Part 2 are substantive in this way. On the whole, however, the book goes wide (too wide) in addressing a broad range of both personal and public (civic) concerns. The civic focus requires separate treatment. Really, a separate book. Also, at times, this book is both over-written and under-written. A reporterâs dilemma. Hard to find the middle ground balancing theory and practice (stories). In brief, at a deeper level, I think the book lacks an idea architecture in many ways. There is no integrating framework offered. His âilluminatorâ frame partially does this but it is not fleshed out and defined rigorously enough. The book is more akin to a reporterâs field learnings coupled with a graduate studentâs enthusiasm. The book has a palpable sense of discovery about it and offers us the promise of learning and seeing in new ways. And, indeed, it does that. Brooks helps us us take stock and see in new ways. Learning these social skills and the âseeing othersâ skills more fully, more attentively, that Brooks points to, however, is not easy. I would have liked him to go deeper explaining how these skills are acquired and deepened. That said, I applaud Brooks task and his field research and his own reflections. He is a good role model in both his personal and professional life in the quest for lived wisdom. See chapter 17, âwhat is wisdom ?â. This is a well intended effort at pulling together this book and his learnings. Finally, his dedication to his deceased friend Peter Marks, his best friend, speaks volumes. Read chapter 10 and his poignant recollections of his friend. Pitch perfect writing found here.",book
"Not finished yet, but especially incisive.EyeOpening. Love David Brooks' books andInterviews.",book
"What would happen if we all took the time to understand another person truly? Beyond surface level but seeing that person's humanity on full display. Not judging, condemning, or suppressing but understanding. This is the question David Brooks answers in ""How to Know A Person.""Brooks wrote a book about a common humanity we all share which is the intrinsic need to be heard, valued, and understood. Each human being craves for this and we live in a culture that prevents that from occurring.Brooks effortlessly blends the fields of psychology, neuroscience, philosophy, ethics, and sociology to present a compelling case for human connection. We need each other and cannot live without interaction. Life would be very difficult without these essentials.This book doesn't talk about a new issue that has arisen but from ages past. However, what David achieves in this book is presenting a healthy alternative that will foster deep change in every sphere and domain of our lives. The antidote to tribalism, polarization, xenophobia, and the like is LOVE. It's simple yet profound. By truly getting to know another in all of their humanity, we love our neighbors deeply.This book is about more than just relationships but the art of loving people. How can we truly love someone to the point where they feel heard, valued, and understood? It only happens through deep empathic listening and compassion. Seeing the world through another's eyes while affirming their experiences.If we let it, this book can help start conversations that could revolutionize society for the common good. David Brooks speaks out of experience and not theoretically. I highly recommend this book to anyone who feels lonely, marginalized, neglected, or misunderstood. This book is a rare gem that we need so desperately.",book
"I admire David Brooks for his incredible writing, research, intelligent analysis, compassion and true kindness. He delves into complicated issues and brings us along with him on his journey. Thank you, Mr. Brooks, for writing this book (and everything else you do at NYT and on PBS). Every sentence in this book touches my heart and life and I promise that it will do so for everyone who reads it. And, it's always truly wonderful to read the personal side of someone who impacts our media interaction; to understand the person behind the person behind the ""pen,"" or screen.",book
"David Brooks has written a wonderful book on one of the most important challenges of our time: In an age of social media and social disconnection and unrest, how can we be better at getting to know and understand others?Brooks explores this subject in a down-to-earth and informative manner, using many examples from his own life and others. He is not preachy, elitist or holier-than-thou about itâhe openly shares his struggles in connecting and understanding other people in a very well written narrative, including stories that clearly illustrate his points.I was afraid this would be too âtouchy feelyâ or academic to be of any use, but Brooks has such a thoughtful approach that it is more like learning from a friend or someone who has your best interest in mind.A very refreshing take on a common human problem: how do you really connect with someone else who is different from you? How do you understand people who disagree with you on politics, religion or other issues?It may be that the future of our country depends on solving some of these questions, so well worth a try.",book
"Mr. Brooks has written an exceptional book that provides a rich history about relationships. Relationships start with seeing people. Not seeing them physically and not even placing people in categories (e.g., Black, male, gay). It's helping to share their stories with you in order that you see them in their entirety. This can happen if you allow yourself to grow, learn, and accept that we humans are mysteries, and we all have our stories. We all want to share those stories, we just need to be seen. Mr. Brooks helps us get the tools for that to happen.",book
"David Brooks never disappoints. I flew through this book. The author talks about so many important things in regards to being present, listening, valuing others, and simply being a good person. After every read I would put the book down and ponder his points. I found myself, and still do, looking for way to simply be kind, listen to others, and try to hear stories that people are wanting to share. You will be a different person after reading this book.",book
"I really enjoyed this book. David Brooks has expanded my own vision on what is possible when attempting to form emotional connections with others, particularly for me at my stage of life generally regarded as âold ageâ. The book felt like a road map to be followed in the quest to see others deeply and hopefully be able to connect emotionally. Perhaps by attempting to do this I too might be deeply seen.",book
"I am devouring this book slowly, one chapter at a time. Itâs the most thoughtful and honest overview of human interactions. I am marking it up with a high lighter and will certainly be revisiting chapters again.",book
You delivered this book in a card board box in the rain. I have spent most of the morning drying page by page. You owe me a new book. surely you can figure out this was a bad idea for shipping.,book
"The media could not be loaded. Where to even begin with Eric Carle's ""The Very Hungry Caterpillar""? This book has been a cornerstone of childhood for countless kidsâand with good reason!First and foremost, the visual elements are stunning. Eric Carleâs unique collage technique brings the story to life in a way that instantly captures the attention of both young and older readers. His choice of bold, vibrant colors is just like eye-candy for the young ones.The tale itself is simple yet profound. A caterpillar eats its way through various foods, both healthy and not-so-healthy, growing bigger and ultimately transforming into a butterfly. On one level, itâs a delightful story about change and growth; on another, it subtly teaches children about the days of the week, counting, and nutrition.I appreciate how the book incorporates little ""holes"" in the pages to indicate where the caterpillar has munched through, adding a tactile element to the reading experience. My 5-year-old loves poking her fingers through the holes, making the story not just a visual but also a sensory delight!Itâs also worth noting that the story is quick and to-the-point, making it perfect for bedtime or for little ones with shorter attention spans. But despite its brevity, it offers a wealth of topics to explore and discuss, from biology and metamorphosis to making healthier food choices.""The Very Hungry Caterpillar"" isn't just a book; it's an interactive, educational experience that both children and adults can enjoy together. It is a tale that transcends time and remains as relevant today as it was when it was first published. If you haven't introduced your children to this story yet, you're missing out on a classic thatâs as nourishing for the mind as it is a delight for the senses.",book

Hard cover book so durable. Cute seasonal story for all ages. I bought this for my nephew who loved it and in fact had me read it 3 times consecutively. I also bought other âHow to Catchâ books and they all are enjoyable. A little expensive but worth the cost as a nice gift.,book

How to catch a mermaid was adorable - this book was weird. It was told from the point of view of the reindeer which was odd. It was doesnât have a good flow - most rhyming books have some kind of meter - neither my husband nor I could find a way to easily read this book to make it sound compelling - it feels wrong to read a rhyming book without since kind of rhythm. Next time Iâll have to buy a how to catch book in store to check out how it reads before purchasing online.,book

With the traditions mentioned in rhyming form with Little Pookie keeping things lively and cute.No need to try to include every modern demographic. Just kept it short and simple with a focus on the day's preparation and family... and pie!",book

"From the first sentence to the last, this book provides the latest and most up-to-date evidence for financial literacy's wholesome power to enrich your entire life. The author tells stories to discover financial literacy and living a good life go hand and hand. Most financial books discuss the dominated and respected quantitative side, the sophisticated science, complicated formulas, and mind-numbing statistics. Reading the traditional personal finance genres makes people erroneously think investors need to be intelligent and aggressive to invest successfully.The Psychology of Money is courageously different. It is about life first and finances second. Donât we want to better understand our behavior, our sense of ourselves and what makes us tick so we can achieve that vibrant and contented life? I know I do.The author skillfully separates the easy part of discovering the investing process versus the hard part. This may shock newbies, but understanding the quantitative aspect of finances, such as constructing a diversified portfolio of low-cost index funds, is the easy part. Look, it is not the little guy or gal versus the massively intimating stock market with the macho goal of beating the average returns. Instead, this book is about understanding our behavior and the decisions we make to achieve a balanced and calm life with accepting reasonable stock market returns. Now thatâs the hard part! But this author makes understanding our behavior achievable and interesting. He accepts whatever skills, experience, or knowledge readers bring to the table.The author brings up an age-old adage that we have been taught by our elders for generationsâdonât take things so personally! With life's many challenges and sometimes negative surprises, isn't it about how we react that counts? Instead, if we respond with wisdom gained from our experiences over the long haul, the challenge itself will eventually be insignificant.The author explains that our reactive behavior, whether the sudden death of a loved one, a broken water pipe damaging our house, or a stock market crash, how we respond to each of these vastly different crises is no different. As a reviewer of this outstanding book, I took the liberty of interpreting the primary theme with my examples. With the death of a loved one, we can blame the doctors, the hospital, and isolate from friends and family, and sob over beers for the rest of your life as a lonely and bitter widow or widower, or you can blame the stock market, your broker, or valueless Wall Street for your portfolio loses. For example, it is well known that millions of investors reacted negatively for over a decade. They sat out with their two to three trillion of the longest bull market in history because they lost money in the 2008 financial crisis. So, no matter what the experience, isn't it always how we react? This book would help those unfortunate investors pull themselves and their portfolio together to get back in the market.To bring mindfulness to our reactions, the author talked about investors' emotions, attitude, and temperament. To be successful in this counterintuitive financial system is to be aware and insightful of this powerful psychological human potentialâyour expectation of future returns. The Goldilocks Principle doesn't have too high return expectations or too low, but somewhere in between. But what is a reasonable expected return?The author reports one of the most significant FACTS of the entire book: The United States Stock Market Returns 6.8% after Inflation. Allow me to repeat, 6.8%.According to the author, our United States capitalistic system produces about 6.8% return minus inflation since the 1870s (3.1% average inflation generates a total return of 9.9%). It is the law of averages, and it is powerful if we know how to tap into it and to be 100% satisfied with average returns (It has been researched many times that too many investors fail to get average returns). Morgan explains how to harness this massive industry and what strategy will get you the average return. The goal is to earn the average return over many years. Why? Two reasons:1. 6.8% return over inflation is a great return!2. Because our emotions will be spared the negative reactions from the massive swings (volatility) of the stock market which will set you up to panic and âget out.âThis book will help you find that ""just right"" balance of your investments and your mind so you can sleep soundly with confidence and reach your financial goals over long periods of time. There is no get rich quick scheme. If a financial adviser or your best friend says that they can beat the averages, walk away, and never listen to that nonsense.Housel encourages all investors by debunking one debilitating myth from the start. All you need to be a successful investor is patience, think long term, and one tiny piece of mathematics, the power of compound interest over decades. You do not need an MBA or a high IQ! In fact, for the newbie financial reader with no financial background or smarts, take heart, you have an advantage. He wrote: ""Ordinary folks with no formal financial education can be wealthy if they have a handful of behavioral skills that have nothing to do with formal measures of intelligence.""That's me! I have never taken a financial course in my life. I flunked 2nd grade and I scored a lower than 100 IQ. But I had a huge advantage because I majored in psychology. Knowing how my mind functioned, I mitigated my return expectations of the market and drama during three of the biggest stock market crashes in history. My expectations for growth and losses are reasonable, balanced between stocks and fixed because I knew what the world-wide stock market returns since 1870. With my mind disciplined to stay the course forever and to do what I can doâcontrol the real deal by keeping expenses low and be extremely happy with reasonable returns. I have perfect control by paying myself instead of some Wall Street mucky muck's yacht.For years, seasoned investors poo-poo psychology (read the one and two-star reviews of this book). There is at least one huge exception. One of the most significant financial thinkers of the 20th century and the mentor and professor of Warren Buffett. Ben Graham wrote said in the very first paragraph of his monumental 623 page The Intelligent Investor, ""â¦little will be said here about the technique of analyzing securities; attention will be paid chiefly to investment principles and investors' attitudes."" (1973 revised, page 1).The author had the great wisdom to cite a book titled âEnoughâ by the legendary John Bogle. Morgan tells stories of people ""hit it big"" (IN THE BILLIONS!). It wasnât ""enough."" They want more, and in the end, they lost it all. Bogleâs most famous quote to get the market averages mentioned previously is to invest in the âentire haystack, do not look for the needle.âThe author makes an important statement that is long overdue and worth repeatingâthe qualitative discussions of investing is more complicated than the quantitative discussions. It is humans that make the decisions and do all the trading on the stock exchanges throughout the world. Last I heard, humans have feelings. Housel says that science is exact and is governed by predictable physical laws. Molecules and atoms do not have feelings! But millions of investors do! Sir Isaac Newton would agree. He famously lamented after losing his investments to the South Sea Disaster in the 18th century, ""I can calculate the motion of heavenly bodies, but not the madness of people."" Knowledge of psychology and behavior will help you understand and protect yourself from the ""madness of people.""The author covers a lot of ground because there is a lot of human behavioral and psychological constructs to explain. Luck vs. skill, attitude vs. math, being average vs. being superior, uncertainty vs. certainty, and confidence born from wisdom vs. overconfidence born from recklessness are impossible to measure and explain. The author correctly labeled these constructs âsoft skillsâ (Hard skills are the math, statistics, graphs, and tables). Luck, attitude, accepting average returns, uncertainty, long-term horizon, and overconfidence are difficult to explain without emotional pushback from some investors. Most seasoned investors want to be intelligent, act aggressive, appear confident, and look sophisticated and soft skills will not get them that image and beat the market.We love to think successes originated on skills, knowledge, intelligence, spreadsheets, and math. The most vital reaction to many seasoned investors is downplaying luck to investment success. But Morgan won't have it. Making money from stock and bond investing is being smart with the complicated reality we face, and spreadsheet knowledge will not be enough. That being lucky is part of the equation. He admits that the luck factor is the question that might not be answered in our lifetimes.In the meantime, there is nothing wrong with being lucky. The returns are green too. But most seasoned investors feel insulted. Warren Buffett always reports that he is an incredibly fortunate investor born in the United States. I am lucky that I am alive after contracting stage two colon cancer twenty years ago. Any one of us could have been born in a small village in India in abject poverty, a shantytown in Lima, Peru, or one of our country's public housing projects.Unfortunately, I gave the book four stars. There was one paragraph that does not belong in the book. I was disappointed. I agree that I might be petty, but that paragraph doesnât make any sense because it doesnât follow the narrative throughout. On page 218, I rewrote here for those who use the indexing strategy, especially Bogleheads:âThat doesnât mean index investing will always work. It doesnât mean it is for everyone. And it doesnât mean active stock picking is doomed to fail. In general, this industry has become too entrenched on one side or the otherâparticularly those vehemently against active investing.âDid the Author Lose His âPsychologyâ for a Moment?I scratched my head and seriously wondered, has the author lost his mind? What in the world motivated the author had to write this when he shares how he invests, and itâs just like most Bogleheads and myself invest with low-cost index funds? I believe I can speak for most Bogleheads: of course, we are âvehemently against active investing!â Itâs expensive and flawed is thoroughly agreed upon by genuine fiduciary financial advisers. Furthermore, there are books, peer-reviewed academic articles, and the Bogleheadsâ forum experiences of how successful the indexing strategy has been overactive management. The author admits on the following page that 85% of active managers fail to beat the averages! The active management strategy has been proven dead for decades, and the authorâs stories debunk active management. Over 35 million investors have their seven trillion dollars with Vanguard and TIAA. We know that active managers from Wall Streetâs big banks and brokerage firms spend a lot of time sipping martinis on their yachts.Other than that hideous paragraph, The Psychology of Money is a fine book because it makes a huge contribution to financial discussions and what it means to be financially literate. The qualitative argument of financial literacy is desperately needed in the financial world. The quantitative argument is appropriate for constructing your portfolio and understanding how markets only return 6.8% average for 150 years. I learned a ton by reading those books too. But after that, no amount of math, sophistication, financial engineering, or science will protect investors from a bear market. Only what is between our ears will. Investors must get our heads behind the idea that we are up against a massive industry that wants to use our money to make money for themselves.The industry is playing a totally different game, different motivation, and most important different life valuesâthey spend 24/7 in front of their powerful computers trading for two goals only, bonuses and beating the averages. I have one more example of luck--We are lucky that Morgan Housel wrote this important work. It is not about looking at your finances 24/7, searching for that investment âgemâ that will make you rich quickly or to compete. At the end of the day, it is about doing our part in making the world a better place than it is now, being generous to those in need, be part of something bigger than yourself, and spending quality time with family and friends.",book
"Psycholology of Money: Timeless Lessons on Wealth, Greed and Happiness by Morgan Housel is a timeless work about how our feelings, emotions and interactions with money often results in different outcomes for different people â because people are different. So, insights into how to think and behave about money is instructive.You may think you donât have enough money to make a difference for your future. I think this book will show you, how even with those thoughts, that you can.Others may believe they have more than enough. Those too are risky thoughts and beliefs.Because people are different, everyone should read this book to see what you uniquely learn about yourself and how you should think about money.Chocked full of great insights to guide us all.Quotes that hit home from various chapters are presented below. There are many more quotes possible, but then youâd miss the message between each quote. I strongly suggest getting the book to see how these below snippets string together into a powerful story about how we think and behave towards money matters.Quote:â¢ Your personal experiences with money make up maybe 0.00000001% of whatâs happened in the world, but maybe 80% of how you think the world works.â¢ Luck and risk are siblings.â¢ Yes, but I have something he will never have â¦ enough.â¢ There is no reason to risk what you have and need for what you donât have and donât need.â¢ The hardest financial skill is getting the goalpost to stop moving.â¢ $81.5 billion of Warren Buffettâs $84.5 billion net worth came after his 65th birthday.â¢ Buffett began serious investing when he was 10 years old.â¢ His skill is investing, but his secret is time. Thatâs how compounding works.â¢ But good investing isnât necessarily about earning the highest returns, because the highest returns tend to be one-off hits that canât be repeated. Itâs about earning pretty good returns that you can stick with and which can be repeated for the longest period of time. Thatâs when compounding runs wild.â¢ Getting wealthy vs. staying wealthy.â¢ Getting money is one thing. Keeping it is another.â¢ Planning is important, but the most important part of every plan is to plan on the plan not going according to plan.â¢ No one is impressed with your possessions as much as you are.â¢ When you see someone driving a nice car, you rarely think, âWow, the guy driving that car is cool.â Instead, you think, âWow, if I had that car people would think Iâm cool.ââ¢ Humility, kindness, and empathy will bring you more respect than horsepower ever will.â¢ Spending money to show people how much money you have is the fastest way to have less money.â¢ Money has many ironies. Hereâs an important one: Wealth is what you donât see.â¢ Past a certain level of income people fall into three groups: Those who save, those who donât think they can save, and those who donât think they need to save.â¢ Building wealth has little to do with your income or investment returns, and lots to do with your savings rate.â¢ The value of wealth is relative to what you need.â¢ Past a certain level of income, what you need is just what sits below your ego.â¢ Peopleâs ability to save is more in their control than they might think.â¢ Things that have never happened before happen all the time.â¢ The thing that makes tail events easy to underappreciate is how easy it is to underestimate how things compound. How, for example, 9/11 prompted the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates, which helped drive the housing bubble, which led to the financial crisis, which led to a poor jobs market, which led to tens of millions to seek a college education, which led to [over a trillion dollars] in student loans with [a high percentage of default rates].â¢ The correct lesson to learn from surprises is that the world is surprising.â¢ The most important part of every plan is planning on your plan not going according to plan.â¢ The purpose of the margin of safety is to render the forecast unnecessary.â¢ The End of History Illusion is what psychologists call the tendency for people to be keenly aware of how much theyâve changed in the past, but to underestimate how much their personalities, desires and goals are likely to change in the future. [Thus, their history of change wonât change anymore into their future].â¢ Every job looks easy when youâre not the one doing it.â¢ Successful investing looks easy when youâre not the one doing it. Hold stocks for the long run â¦ but do you know how hard it is to maintain a long-term outlook when stocks are collapsing?â¢ Price â¦ not dollars and cents â¦ itâs volatility, fear, doubt, uncertainty â¦ all of which are easy to overlook until youâre dealing with them in real time.â¢ Beware of taking financial cues from people playing a different game than you are.â¢ When investors have different goals and time horizons â and they do in every asset class â prices that look ridiculous to one person can make sense to another, because the factors those investors pay attention to are different.â¢ The interesting thing about [absolutely pessimistic] stories is that their polar opposite â forecasts of outrageous optimism â are rarely taken as seriously as prophets of doom.â¢ Pessimism just sounds smarter and more plausible than optimism.â¢ â¦progress happens too slowly to notice, but setbacks happen too quickly to ignore.â¢ The more you want something to be true, the more likely you are to believe a story that overestimates the odds of it being true.â¢ We donât know what we donât know.â¢ Coming to terms with how much you donât know means coming to terms with how much of what happens in the world is out of your control. And that can be hard to accept.â¢ Less ego, more wealth.â¢ If you want to to do better as an investor, the single most powerful thing you can do is increase your time horizon.Unquote.Thereâs a lot of wisdom alone in the various quotes above. Thereâs even more wisdom reading how they string together to see the larger story line to understand your psychology of money applied in your own life.Each person reading Houselâs work will get something different out of it than someone else. And each time you read it (I suggest more than once) you too will get yet still something else out of it.",book
This is a definite recommend. It is an easy to read and easy to understand book that points out the obvious not so obvious key to figuring out that you have to stop trying to impress people. When you conquer that beast then youâre free yourself to free yourself. Let that marinate for a moment.â,book

"Housel is an award winning business writer with investing experience. He covers a number of topics in investing with a slightly different slant. He makes a good argument that many of us would be happier or more satisfied if we spend more time in pursuit of small, personally appealing adventures and interests instead of pursuing more money.He quotes successful people on how they achieve balance. For instance Harry Moskowitz, Nobel prize winner in economics for his work on risk and reward, said that deciding how much of his funds to put into the stock market he visualized his grief if the stock market went way up and he wasn't in it, or if it went way down and he was completely in it. So he split his contributions 50-50 between bonds and in equities.Examples of other famous investors such as Warren Buffett who has one of the best investment records available. He points out that one of the reasons for his great wealth is that he invested very early and has kept the money compounding over a very long period of time -close to 80 years. Besides being very, very wealthy Buffett still tap dances to work, and has shown he still has the ability to learn new tricks in investing.Part of the way he did this was to hang onto investments for long periods of time, even with his exceptional skill at picking stocks and businesses it turns out that only about 10 of 3-400 hundred of investments resulted in very large profits. It takes special ability to have large profits in a given investment and to continue to hold it even while it goes up and down. The author doesn't give you much help in how to accomplish this feat.Another point is you get wealthy not by spending most of your money, but by saving most of your money and letting it compound over long periods of time. How much do you invest and how much risk do you take with most of the money depends on knowing yourself. Do you want to be in a position where you have enough cash so if the market goes down heavily and you have the courage, you can invest that money in the investment you're interested in? This is contrary to what most people do who are relatively fully invested near the top and then sell investments as the market goes down. They are losing too much and sell usually at a substantially lower price than they bought the investment. So you have to have enough money invested so that over the long term that it goes up enough to make you wealthier, but not so much that you decide that you've lost too much and sell at a big loss. Added to the problem is the fact that just because a company has bounced up and down before doesn't necessarily guarantee that it's going to bounce back again. Using low cost index funds generally evens out the ups and downs to some degree.Knowledge of the history of economic investment results is helpful, but fails to predict what is actually going to happen in the future. Part of being an investor is being able to predict how you are going to react to the worst and the best things that can happen to your investments. One of the most important attributes is the ability to change your mind as the world around you changes. The author includes many examples of how famous investors have coped with various problems and are quite informative.Perhaps the most valuable lesson or example is the author and his wife decided early in their careers that economic freedom, that is enough money to make their own choices later in life was worth doing. They could live comfortably without the joy of doing everything you want immediately. Instead they saved all of the raises they've gotten over the years of their income. He doesn't give actual numbers or even percentages for savings, but they are well towards their goal of complete financial independence. A great feeling if you can do it without sacrificing things that you really enjoy. Like the author perhaps you enjoy reading, walking, and podcasts- it's a good start.His method is to invest in low cost index funds, Vanguard, and basically hold forever or until his family retires. A large part of my own portfolio follows the same plan and this has worked very well. Hope you all achieve it.",book
expanded my knowledge on a lot of concepts to do with money. personally i really enjoyed it and read it quite fast,book
"âI spent half my time loving her and the other half hiding how much I loved her.âThis is one of the best books Iâve ever had the privilege to read. It is probably in the top five for best books Iâve ever read in my entire life. I have been looking for a book like this my entire life, and no combination of words Iâm about to type, and youâre about to read, is going to do this masterpiece justice. But I will say that Gabby, Joce, Amelie, and Elyse were all right, and Iâm so happy I listened to them, because this book is worth every single ounce of hype.And when I say that this book is lifechanging, I truly mean it. This book is sold as a historical romance, where you learn about a fictional, famous, old Hollywood actress and all her marriages. What you get is a book that stars a bisexual, Cuban woman who was never allowed to talk about the love of her life; her wife. And when I say I cried during this book, I truly mean that I probably need to buy a new copy because I was the biggest mess youâve ever seen.âAnd it will be the tragedy of my life that I cannot love you enough to make you mine. That you cannot be loved enough to be anyoneâs.âOn top of this being a powerful book about race, sexuality, misogyny, and having to conform to societies norms, the true meaning I took from this book is that life is short, so damn short, and we shouldnât spend it pretending to be something we arenât. And we shouldnât spend it doing anything less than loving the people who are worthy and deserving of our love.âI didnât need boys in order to feel good. And that realization gave me great power.âWe follow Evelyn from the very start; losing her mother very young, her body developing very quickly, noticing others noticing her developing body, marrying a man so she can leave the dead-end city she grew up in, so she can become something more. Evelyn is unapologetic with her actions, and it is one of the most empowering things Iâve ever read. She plays so many more parts than the roles she is cast in. And Evelyn learns really quickly how to play each and every man she is forced to interact with, and she quickly learns what she can gain from each and every one of them, too.This story is told from two different timelines and two different points of view. One from Monique Grant, who is a biracial (white and African-American) woman who is going through a fresh divorce and trying to make something of herself in the journalism field. And her life changes the day her editor tells her how Evelyn Hugo is demanding her, and only her, to write something for her.âHeartbreak is loss. Divorce is a piece of paper.âThe other timeline(s) are all the different times in Evelynâs life, and the different seven husbands that she had, while she is recounting the events that lead her to be telling Monique this story. Evelyn has lived a very full life, and is in her late seventies now, and is finally ready to talk about her life. But the entire book we are guessing why she has chosen only Monique for this job.âMake them pay you what they would pay a white man.âIf you guys have been following my reviews, youâll probably know that I talk about found family and how important it is to me a lot, but The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo is the epitome of how beautiful a found family can be. Evelyn and Harryâs friendship in this was one of the most beautiful things Iâve ever read in my entire reading life.âWhen you write the ending, Monique, make sure the reader understands that all I was ever really looking for was family. Make sure itâs clear that I found it. Make sure they know that I am heartbroken without it.âAnd the romance? The true romance in this book is the most romantic thing I have ever read in my entire life. And you guys know Iâve read a ton of romances, but they are all lesser to this. Every single one of them canât compare with the romance in this book. I feel like every time Iâve used the word âperfectâ to describe something that wasnât the romance in this book, then I used the word wrong.âPlease never forget that the sun rises and sets with your smile. At least to me it does. Youâre the only thing on this planet worth worshipping.âHow many Evelyn and Celias are there in the world? How many are still playing the role that Evelyn was forced to play? I cry for every single person who must hide who they are, and who they want to love. And this book talks about many big things in LGBTQIAP+ history; from the Stonewall riots to the disgusting Reagan administration, but life still isn't anywhere close to equal in 2018. The prejudices, the discrimination, the virus/syndrome blaming, the looks Iâve experienced holding a girlâs hand while walking into a restaurant? Those are still in 2018, in the United States, but people act like none of those things exists because marriage is legalized, begrudgingly. Iâm not writing this review to get on my soapbox, but I promise, we have a lot more work to do. And this book, this book lit a fire under me.I personally identify as pansexual, but I felt like the bisexual rep in this was a tier above anything my eyes have ever seen. Seeing Evelyn love all the parts of her, and all the different parts of her love, was something so awe-inspiring. I am still so overwhelmed with feelings, but if you identify as bi or pan, this is a love letter to you, I promise.âI was a lesbian when she loved me and a straight woman when she hated me.âThis book also focuses a huge importance on motherhood throughout the entirety of this book, and then I read the acknowledgement and started weeping all over again. Taylor Jenkins Reid was able to evoke the strongest emotions from me, and I just pray that things will be different for the generation of kids being raised right now.This was the first thing Iâve read by Taylor Jenkins Reid, but I will buy every single new thing she produces. The writing was so lyrical and addicting. I mean, I have a quote between almost every paragraph. This whole book deserves to be highlighted. The characters, well, my mind has now forever imagined that these are real people now, so there is that. The topics, themes, and discussions are beyond important. This book just makes me feel so passionately. This book is one of the most empowering pieces of literature Iâve ever consumed. And I am not the same person I was before this book.âI told her every single day that her life had been the worldâs greatest gift to me, that I believed I was put on earth not to make movies or wear emerald-green gowns and wave at crowds but to be her mother.âIf you guys ever take a recommendation from me; please have it be The Seven Husbands of Evelyn Hugo. Please, Iâm actually begging you. I promise, this book is lifechanging, and I equally promise you that this book changed mine. There is magic between these four-hundred-pages. Pure magic. This story is addicting, enthralling, and so important. And if youâre an Evelyn, in 2018, I see you, but I hope it doesnât take you as long as it took her to be happy. This will forever be one of the best books of my life, and Iâll cherish it forever.âPeople think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth.

"âPeople think that intimacy is about sex. But intimacy is about truth. When you realize you can tell someone your truth, when you can show yourself to them, when you stand in front of them bare and their response is 'you're safe with me'- that's intimacy.âTaylor Jenkins Reidâs THE SEVEN HUSBANDS OF EVELYN HUGO tells the authentic story of legendary Hollywood actress Evelyn Hugo through an autobiographical medium, with ambitious âVivantâ journalist Monique Grant scribing her tale. Throughout the interview, Hugo reveals the behind-the-scenes secrets of her life acting in the film industry, detailing how she repressed her Cuban heritage to conform to the Hollywood scene, how she not only experienced but capitalized on the industryâs sexism and double standards, how she used her body and married famous men to get her to the top, how she found true friendship and forbidden love, and how she admits that she would do it all again if given a chance. As Hugo engrosses Grant and the readers with her story, the question of âwhy would a famous Hollywood actress want to speak with an up-and-coming journalist like Monique Grant, why her?â lingers in the back of our minds, and soon, we learn the real reason why Hugo wanted Grant to write her autobiography. As a student enrolled in an Intermediate Fiction Writing course, I was particularly eager to review this novel after reading it for the first time last year. To say that I thoroughly enjoyed reading it is an understatement.Taylor Jenkins Reid never fails to impress me with her craft in creating and developing characters, I find that to be a strong element of the novel that contributed to my appeal; Evelyn Hugo is one of the most compelling protagonists I have ever read about in my entire life, and I adored the fact that she was all morally shades of grey and not a good person when it came to her rise to the top of the Hollywood ladder. She felt no regrets about the manipulations and schemes she created to get her to the singularity, which thrilled me, but seeing her vulnerable side away from the flashing cameras was also a real treat. Harry Cameron and Celia St. James serve as strong secondary characters who held a major influence on Hugo; one whom she shared a deep platonic connection with, and the other, to whom she was helplessly in love with and devoted. Taylor Jenkins Reid wonderfully illustrates the ups and downs of the friendship between Evelyn and Harry, the struggles and clashes between Evelyn and Celia, and the tragedy Evelyn experienced losing them both.Another element that stood out to me was the setting of the novel. Hugoâs interview reveals how she built and stepped away from her career as a renowned Hollywood actress, often inspiring her to move across different locations to preserve her private image. To her detriment and benefit, the press follows Hugo wherever she goes, with journalist companies like âSub Rosa,â âPhotoMoment,â âHollywood Digest,â and the âNew York Tribuneâ writing articles about her fabricated life (while not realizing it), and spreading gossip. Seeing those newspaper clippings pop up in the chapters gives the novel a sparkling touch, making the environment feel more authentic. It also is no surprise that Taylor Jenkins Reid took inspiration from Old Hollywood icons such as Marilyn Monroe and Elizabeth Taylor to craft the character of Evelyn Hugo; she fits right into the time period where her story blossoms.Finally, the last element that stood out to me above all else was Evelynâs plot arc. She goes from feeling determined to make it to the singularity and steal the audience's attention to wanting to give it all up for Celia St. James, the love of her life, in a way that feels so natural and real. Her wanting to build an image as a renowned actress came from wanting to get out of Hellâs Kitchen and prove to people, especially her abusive father, that she has the talent and worth to make it big. But, as she meets and falls for Celia, she feels compelled to spend every moment with her, and she keeps up her work ethic but hides her feelings so the career she sacrificed so much of her authentic self for doesnât die in vain. Of course, that comes with hardships in her relationship with Celia, but we see how her decision to leave all of the Hollywood glory behind makes sense after the fact. Itâs bittersweet.If youâre in the market for a juicy contemporary beach read or a compelling novel that handles serious topics elegantly, THE SEVEN HUSBANDS OF EVELYN HUGO is worth a read and is the book for you.",book
"With so many heavy topics discussed in this book, I really think Taylor Jenkins Reid did a beautiful job showing us the complexities of each one of them. Along with the simple complexity of just being human. This book covers the story of a woman from 13 years old to her death at 79 and everything that happened in between including what leads her to Monique Grant to write her memoirs, ending the book with a connection between the two you will never see coming. I never expected to relate to a movie star from the 50s but hearing Evelyn's story reminded me of my own life and it's amazing how the author did that so beautifully.",book
"This is one of the better books I've read in a long time! I belong to a book club so sometimes I don't read descriptions or reviews well before reading the book (because I'm going to read it anyway) but I was so pleasantly surprised by this! It was deeper and I cared more about the characters than I thought I was going to. Great storytelling, and this came out at the perfect time with so many stories of Hollywood abuse coming out. I would love to see this as a movie.",book
"I have never had a book reap such emotion from me, I have never cried reading a book. That being said it was only the end that made me cry, no spoilers, but chapter 62 did it for me. Followed by immediate shock and the feeling of betrayal!Throughout the course of the book I feel as though I felt the emotions evoked from each marriageâ¦every lossâ¦every slanderous word said of Evelyn. And while the book was focused around Evelynâs life and we received so little of Monique, I still felt that I knew her so well. I mourned for her and celebrated her in the few chapters focused on her own life!I loved this book and have to place this in my top 3 favorite books Iâve ever read, perhaps maybe even #1! Only time will tell",book
"Starting at the young age of fourteen and ending when sheâs seventy-nine (when we first meet Evelyn), Evelyn Hugo has gone from bombshell, to sexpot, to Oscar winner, to civil rights supporter. Evelyn knew what she wanted from an early ageâto get out of Hellâs Kitchen and away from her abusive father, and to be the biggest star anyone has ever heard of. And she accomplished that! Partially because of her talent, partially because she knows her worth and is unafraid to get dirty in order to achieve her goals, and partially because there is no one better at using the press and scandals to serve their own interests. Evelyn is both a force to be reckoned with, but also a deeply flawed and lonely. Shown through the perspective of Evelyn as she dictates her memoir to Monique, the reader is taken back to the early days of Hollywood to watch Evelynâs rise, and her stumbles, to and through stardom. For a story about a Hollywood starlet, this book is LAYERED, and I donât think I was expecting the level of depth it had, even though many reviews warned me to expect the unexpected with this story.In order to become Evelyn Hugo, Hollywoodâs biggest star, Evelyn had to let go of who she was; erasing her identity to be what Hollywood wanted her to be. She knew and accepted this, always, but it does break your heart a little to watch her identity get stripped away so that she could be the blonde bombshell the screen so loved. The things Evelyn hid or changed, often denying the realest parts of herself in the process, really hit me in the feels, and there were parts at the end of the book that had me welling up with tears if that tells you anything. I wonât say more because the way the story unfolds is really lovely with getting to know all 7 of Evelynâs husbands and the roles they played in her life, but I will say that I LOVED the inclusion of the fake articles to show the juxtaposition between what was Evelynâs reality versus what the public got to see, and how the press portrayed her in return.Honestly, there was very little I did not like about this book, or its story. It flowed beautifully and, while not necessarily one of those books you couldnât put down (I had no issues stopping in reading for the night) it was never dull. It had a smooth, and highly enjoyable writing style. However, my only issues were that sometimes, with the book being told in 1st person, Monique didnât always feel that distinct to me from Evelyn. Which may be mostly because we donât really get to know Monique at the same level at which we get to know Evelyn, though I did enjoy their relationship and how they were able to help each other, even when that got . . . tricky, to say the least. But I also didnât like Celia for a majority of the book, either. I found her to be so frustrating at times, that I often wondered why Evelyn even bothered having her around. Thankfully that changed toward the end, but still.But, all in all, I LOVED this book and this story. It was so empowering, watching Evelyn be so unashamed to own her beauty, her sex appeal, her confidence, and to be the ball-buster she was, so unafraid of telling people what she wants, what she deservesâall because she knows her worth. I didnât know how much I needed a story, to see a woman like that, until I read this book. But I also loved that the author didnât shy away from Evelynâs flaws, or the fact that, for a lot of Evelynâs life, she was deeply lonely. Evelyn wasnât perfect, but she didnât let that be an excuse for anyone to treat her poorly. I will say there are some instances of spousal abuse in this book though, so just be forewarned if that kind of trauma is sensitive for you. I thought the author handled those topics amazingly well, but Iâve also never experienced such things for myself, either. Because this book brought tears to my eyes with that whole last third of the story, it easily gets 5 stars from me! This is such a satisfying, and empowering book!",book
"I could not put this book down! I usually like thrillers and mystery books and wasn't sure I'd be into something like this but I was so wrong. I went through this book like it was nothing.

"Taylor Jenkins Reid hit the best seller lists with this take on an Elizabeth Taylor-Like character. She has rarely left those lists for the years that followed. Daisy Jones and the Six was on the lists for more than a year -- and then it was made into a very well received television production. Reid writes accessible fiction that clearly speaks to today's readers. This was one was set in a pre-Stonewell world of the movies and it's stars. The surprising choice of the elderly actress of an author to write her biography, a relatively unknown writer for a cultural magazine, gives an interesting perspective, begins the book and in a way ends it as well.

This is easily my new favorite book. Not really any smut, not the kinda romance I expected but the kinda romance I needed, just pure story across an entire lifetime with many characters. This book made me feel good in my core, this book made me look at my own life and my own choices and had me feel soo recognized and called out at the same time.

"This 2023 book âOutlive: The Science and Art of Longevityâ by Peter Attia, M.D. (with acknowledged contributions by others including Bill Gifford) is a wonderful mix of facts, medical advice, personal and family anecdotes and opinions for living a long life that you, your friends, relatives, and medical professionals will enjoy. One main recommendation is to exercise regularly (in specific ways) while avoiding injury. He recommends particular medical tests. The book is worth purchasing and reading to understand how to live a longer healthier life. As an example of the substance and style of this book, Attia writes: âThe information and advice presented in this book are not meant to substitute for the advice of your familyâs physician or other trained healthcare professionals. You are advised to consult with healthcare professionals with regard to all matters pertaining to you and your familyâs health and well-being.â Attia writes: âas a surgical resident at Johns Hopkins, I would learn that death comes at two speeds: fast and slowâ¦ Ultimatelyâ¦ slow deaths ended up bothering me even more. But this is not a book about deathâ¦ [but about] longevityâ¦ Longevity does notâ¦ mean merely notching more and more birthdays as we slowly wither awayâ¦ In 1900, life expectancy hovered somewhere south of age fifty, and most people were likely to die from âfastâ causes: accidents, injuries, and infectious diseasesâ¦ the odds are overwhelming that you will die as a result of one of the chronic diseases of aging that I call the Four Horsemen: heart disease, cancer, neurodegenerative disease, or type 2 diabetes and related metabolic dysfunctionâ¦ Longevity has two components. how long you liveâ¦ [and] the quality of your yearsâ¦ called healthspanâ¦ defined as the period of life when we are free from disability or diseaseâ¦ Death rates from cancer, on the other hand, have hardly budged in the more than fifty years since the War on Cancer was declared, despite hundreds of billions of dollarsâ worth ofâ¦ spending on research. Type 2 diabetes remains a raging public health crisis, showing no sign of abating, and Alzheimerâs disease and related neurodegenerative diseases stalk our growing elderly populationâ¦ None of our treatments for late-stage lung cancer has reduced mortality by nearly as much as the worldwide reduction in smoking that has occurred over the last two decades, thanks in part to widespread smoking bans. This simple preventive measure (not smoking) has saved more lives than any late-stage intervention that medicine has devisedâ¦ Medicineâs biggest failing is [treating] all these conditionsâ¦ after they are entrenchedârather than before they take root.â Attia writes: âThe metabolic derangement that leads to type 2 diabetes also helps foster and promote heart disease, cancer, and Alzheimerâs diseaseâ¦ all âdietsâ are similarâ¦ protein becomes critically important as we ageâ¦ Exercise is by far the most potent longevity âdrug.â No other intervention does nearly as much to prolong our lifespan and preserve our cognitive and physical function. But mostâ¦ donât do nearly enoughâand exercising the wrong way can do as much harm as goodâ¦â Attia writes: âthere have been two distinct eras in medical history, and [we are] on the verge of a thirdâ¦ Hippocratesâs major contribution was the insight that diseases are caused by nature and not byâ¦ the godsâ¦ Medicine 2.0 arrived in the mid-nineteenth century with the advent of the germ theory of disease... [and] eradicated deadly diseases such as polio and smallpoxâ¦ Yet Medicine 2.0 has proved far less successful against long-term diseases such as cancerâ¦ lifespans have nearly doubled since the late 1800s, [almost] entirely from antibiotics and improved sanitation... if you subtract out deaths from the eight top infectious diseasesâ¦ overall mortality rates declined relatively little over the course of the twentieth centuryâ¦ [The goal of] Medicine 3.0âisâ¦ to be thrivingâ¦ throughout the latter half of our livesâ¦ Lifespanâ¦ is binary: youâre alive, and then youâre dead. Itâs final. But before that happensâ¦ most people suffer through a period of decline thatâ¦ is like dying in slow motionâ¦ while actual death is inevitable, this deteriorationâ¦ is less soâ¦ If you increase your muscle strength and improve your cardiorespiratory fitness, you have also reduced your risk of dyingâ¦â Attia writes: â[Exercise] components [are]: strength, stability, aerobic efficiency, and peak aerobic capacity. We want to maintain physical strength, stamina, stability across a broad range of movements, while remaining free from pain and disabilityâ¦ exercise [is] the most potent longevity âdrugâ in our arsenal, in terms of lifespan and healthspan. The data are unambiguous: exercise not only delays actual death but also prevents both cognitive and physical decline, better than any other interventionâ¦â Attia writes: âdata comes from studies ofâ¦ people who have lived to the age of one hundred and beyond, often in good healthâ¦ many of them get to enjoy one, or two, or even three Bonus Decadesâ¦. Researchersâ¦ [found that] individuals [had] very little in common with one another geneticallyâ¦ Natural selection has endowed us with genes that work beautifully to help us develop, reproduce, and then raise our offspring [but] after the age of reproduction, natural selection loses much of its forceâ¦ [Yet] a handful of potential longevity genesâ¦ are possibly relevant to our strategy. One [gene]â¦ called â¦ APOE (apolipoprotein E) that is involved in cholesterol transport and processing, and it has three variants: e2, e3, and e4â¦ The e2 variant of APOEâ¦ seems to protect its carriers against dementiaâand it also turns out to be very highly associated with longevityâ¦ FOXO3 belongs to a family of âtranscription factors,â which regulate how other genes are expressedâmeaning whether they are activated or âsilenced.ââ¦ When FOXO3 is activated, it in turn activates genes that generally keep our cells healthier. It seems to play an important role in preventing cells from becoming cancerous as well.â Attia writes: âgene expression can be influenced by your environment and your behaviorsâ¦ a 2007 study found that older people who were put on a regular exercise program shifted to a more youthful pattern of gene expression after six months. This suggests that genetics and environment both play a role in longevity and that it may be possible to implement interventions that replicate at least some of the centenariansâ good genetic luckâ¦ think of centenarians as the results of a natural experiment that tells us something important about living longer and living betterâ¦ The experiment entails taking a random collection of human genomes and exposing them to a variety of environments and behaviors. The centenarians possess the correct combination of genome X required to survive in environment Y (perhaps with help from behaviors Z).â Attia writes: âProtein aggregates have been implicated in diseases such as Parkinsonâs and Alzheimerâs disease, so getting rid of them is good; impaired autophagy has been linked to Alzheimerâs diseaseâ¦ and also to amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Parkinsonâs disease, and other neurodegenerative disordersâ¦ By cleansing our cells of damaged proteins and other cellular junk, autophagy allows cells to run more cleanly and efficiently and helps make them more resistant to stressâ¦ The FDA has given the green light for a clinical trial of another drug with potential longevity benefits, the diabetes medication metforminâ¦ studies appeared to confirmâ¦ that patients on metformin appeared to have a lower incidence of cancer than the general populationâ¦ diabetics on metformin actually lived longer than nondiabetics[striking!].â Attia writes: âIn the late 1970s, the average American adult male weighed 173 pounds. Now the average American man tips the scale at nearly 200 poundsâ¦ According to the [CDC] more than 40 percent of the US population is obeseâ¦ another thirdâ¦ is overweight (BMI of 25 to 30)â¦ visceral fat is linked to increased risk of both cancer and cardiovascular diseaseâ¦ fat-storage capacity seems to be influenced by genetic factorsâ¦ our metabolism, as it has evolved over millennia, is not equipped to cope with our ultramodern diet, which has appeared only within the last century or soâ¦ We needed toâ¦ endure periods of time without much food, and natural selection obliged, endowing us with genes that helped us conserve and store energy in the form of fatâ¦ to survive periods of famine, cold climates, andâ¦ illness and pregnancy.â Attia writes: âAt some point, our primate ancestors underwent a random genetic mutation that effectively switched on their ability to turn fructose into fatâ¦ This newfound ability to store fat enabled them to survive in the colder climateâ¦ But in our modern world, this fat-storage mechanism has outlived its usefulnessâ¦ It is very difficult to get fat from eating too many apples, for example, because the fructose in the apple enters our system relatively slowly, mixed with fiber and water, and [we] can handle it normallyâ¦ I test my patientsâ levels of uric acid, not only because high levels may promote fat storage but also because it is linked to high blood pressureâ¦ While heart disease is the most prevalent age-related condition, it is also more easily prevented than either cancer or Alzheimerâs diseaseâ¦ atherosclerotic diseaseâ¦ still kills more people than cancer in the [US] each yearâ¦ Heart disease remains our deadliest killer, â¦ [but] this should be the tenth leading cause of death, not the first.â Attia writes: âThe reason theyâre called high-and low-density lipoproteins (HDL and LDL, respectively) has to do with the amount of fat relative to protein that each one carries... itâs not the cholesterol per se that causes problems but the nature of the particle in which itâs transportedâ¦ Another major misconception about heart disease is that it is somehow caused by the cholesterol that we eat in our dietâ¦ The humble eggâ¦ has remained in nutritional purgatory for decades, even after reams of research papers showing that dietary cholesterol (and particularly egg consumption) may not have much to do with heart disease at allâ¦ The vast majority of the cholesterol in our circulation is actually produced by our own cellsâ¦ dietary guidelines finallyâ¦ conceded (in 2015) that âcholesterol is not a nutrient of concern for overconsumption.â Glad we settled thatâ¦ the American Heart Association guidelines still favor LDL-C testing instead of apoB. I have all my patients tested for apoB regularly, and you should ask for the same test the next time you see your doctorâ¦ We are fortunate that many of these conditions can be modulated or nearly eliminatedâincluding apoB, by the wayâvia lifestyle changes and medicationsâ¦ I take a very hard line on lowering apoB, the particle that causes all this trouble. (In short: get it as low as possible, as early as possible.)â¦ if we all maintained the apoB levels we had when we were babies, there wouldnât be enough heart disease on the planet for people to know what it wasâ¦ In my clinical experience, about a third to half of people who consume high amounts of saturated fatsâ¦ will experience a dramatic increase in apoB particles, which we obviously donât want. Monounsaturated fats, found in high quantities in extra virgin olive oil, macadamia nuts, and avocados (among other foods), do not have this effect... The point is not necessarily to limit fat overall but to shift to fats that promote a better lipid profileâ¦ But for many patients... lowering apoBâ¦ cannot be accomplished with diet alone... Statins are far and away the most prescribed class of drugs for lipid management... statinsâ¦ are very helpful drugs for reducing apoB or LDL concentration in many patients... For people who canât tolerate statins, I [prescribe] bempedoic acid (Nexletol),â Attia writes: âLike heart disease, cancer is a disease of aging. That is, it becomes exponentially more prevalent with each decade of lifeâ¦ there were more cancer deaths among people between forty-five and sixty-four than from heart diseaseâ¦ The problem we face is that once cancer is established, we lack highly effective treatments for it. Our toolbox is limitedâ¦ surgery is of limited value when cancer has metastasized, or spread. Metastatic cancers can be slowed by chemotherapy, but they virtually always come backâ¦ Cancer cellsâ¦ stop listening to the bodyâs signals that tell them when to grow and when to stop growingâ¦ a gene called PTEN, which normally stops cells from growing or dividing (and eventually becoming tumors), is often mutated or âlostâ in people with cancer, including about 31 percent of men with prostate cancer and 70 percent of men with advanced prostate cancer. Such âtumor suppressorâ genes are critically important to our understanding of the diseaseâ¦ not only is breast cancer genetically distinct from colon cancer (as the researchers expected), but no two breast cancer tumors are very much alikeâ¦ With a few exceptionsâ¦ solid organ tumors typically kill you only when they spread to other organsâ¦ Prostate cancer kills only when it becomes metastaticâ¦ Once cancer has spread, the entire game changesâ¦ excess weight is a leading risk factor for both cancer cases and deaths, second only to smokingâ¦ Obesity itself is strongly associated with thirteen different types of cancersâ¦ [For] colorectal cancer (CRC)â¦ About 70 percent of people who are diagnosed with CRC before the age of fifty have no family history or hereditary conditions linked to the diseaseâ¦ Of all the Horsemen, cancer is probably the hardest to preventâ Attia writes: âIn the [US], about 6 million people are diagnosed with Alzheimerâs diseaseâ¦ 1 million have been diagnosed with Parkinsonâs... Exercise is the only intervention shown to delay the progression of Parkinsonâsâ¦ Having type 2 diabetes doubles or triples your risk of developing Alzheimerâs disease, about the same as having one copy of the APOE e4 geneâ¦ APOE e4â¦ seems to accelerate other risk factors and driver mechanisms for Alzheimerâsâ¦ Curiously, APOE e4 was not always a bad actorâ¦ The e3 mutation showed up about 225,000 years ago, while e2 is a relative latecomer, arriving only in the last 10,000 yearsâ¦ In environments where infectious disease was a leading cause of death, APOE e4 carriers may have been the lucky ones, in terms of longevityâ¦ The single most powerful item in our preventive tool kit is exerciseâ¦ Strength training is likely just as importantâ¦ I now tell patients that exercise isâ¦ the best tool we have in the neurodegeneration prevention tool kitâ¦ Sleep is also a very powerful tool against Alzheimerâs disease... Sleep disruptions and poor sleep are potential drivers of increased risk of dementiaâ¦ There is a growing body of research linking oral healthâ¦ with overall healthâ¦ The conundrum we face is that our environment has changed dramatically over the last century or two, in almost every imaginable wayâour food supply and eating habits, our activity levelsâ¦ Our genes no longer match our environment. Thus, we must be cunning in our tacticsâ¦toâ¦ thriveâ Attia writes: âexercise has the greatest power to determine how you will live out the rest of your lifeâ¦ even a fairly minimal amount of exercise can lengthen your life by several years. It delays the onset of chronic diseases, pretty much across the board, but it is also amazingly effective at extending and improving healthspanâ¦ So if you adopt only one new set of habits based on reading this book, it must be in the realm of exerciseâ¦â Attia writes: âeach of us needs to be training for the Centenarian Decathlonâ¦ [Decide on] the ten most important physical tasks you will want to be able to do for the rest ofâ¦ your lifeâ¦ [Consider a] long list of physical tasks that might include some of the following: Get up off the floor under your own powerâ¦ Lift a twenty-pound suitcase into the overhead compartment of a planeâ¦ [from say] more than fifty different items.... [then] select which of these tasks [you] want to be able to performâ¦ in [your] ninthâ¦ decade. [then] come up with a list of tenâ¦ to become a different sort of athlete altogether: an athlete of lifeâ¦ I structure my training around exercises that improve the followingâ¦ Grip strengthâ¦ to be able to lift the weight up and put it back down, slowly and with controlâ¦ Pulling motionsâ¦ Hip-hinging movements... I focus on these four foundational elements of strength because they are the most relevant to our Centenarian Decathlonâ¦ studies suggest that grip strengthâliterallyâ¦ how hard you can squeeze something with one handâpredicts how long you are likely to liveâ¦ Itâs not about telling you what to eat; itâs about figuringâ¦ out what works for your body and your goalsâand, just as important, what you can stick toâ¦âAttia writes: âNutrition is relatively simple.... donât eat too many calories, or too few; consume sufficient protein and essential fats; obtain the vitamins andâ¦ minerals you need; and avoid pathogensâ¦ Beyond that, we know relatively little with complete certainty. Read that sentence again, pleaseâ¦ a lot of the old clichÃ© expressions are probably right: If your great-grandmother would not recognize it, youâre probably better off not eatingâ¦ Plants are very good to eat. Animal protein is âsafeâ to eat. We evolved as omnivores; ergo, most of us can probably find excellent health as omnivores.â Attia writes: âsome clinical trials have provided some useful bits of knowledge. One of theâ¦ clinical trialsâ¦ show a clear advantage for the Mediterranean dietâor at least, for nuts and olive oilâ¦ The study was meant to last six years, but in 2013â¦ halted it prematurely, after just four and a half years, because the results were so dramaticâ¦ The group receiving the olive oil had about a one-third lower incidence (31 percent) of stroke, heart attack, and death than the low-fat group, and the mixed-nuts group showed a similar reduced risk (28 percent). It was therefore deemed unethical to continue the low-fat arm of the trial. By the numbers, the nuts-or-olive-oil âMediterraneanâ diet appeared to be as powerful as statinsâ¦â Attia writes: âSAD, the Standard American Diet [is] almost as devastating to most people as tobacco when consumed in large quantitiesâ¦ The farther away we get from the SAD, the better off we will beâ¦ The real artâ¦ [is] finding the best mix of macronutrientsâ¦ [and] an eating pattern [that one] can sustainâ¦ our four macronutrients: alcohol, carbohydrates, protein, and fatâ¦ Alcohol serves no nutritional or health purpose but is a purely hedonic pleasure that needs to be managed. Itâs especially disruptive for people who are overnourished... itâs an âemptyâ calorie source that offers zero nutrition valueâ¦ chronic drinking has strong associations with Alzheimerâs disease, mainly via its negative effect on sleepâ¦ it loosens inhibitions around other kinds of food consumptionâ¦â Attia writes: âMany studies have found powerful associations between insufficient sleep (less than seven hours a night, on average) and adverse health outcomes ranging from increased susceptibility to the common cold to dying of a heart attackâ¦ As important as sleep is for the body, it may even be more so for the brain. Good sleep, in terms of not only quantity but quality, is critical to our cognitive functionâ¦ there is a growing body of evidence that sleeping well is essential to preserving our cognition as we age and staving off Alzheimerâs disease.â",book
"When we are born, we aren't given an owner's manual. But now we have the book, ""Outlive: The Science and Art of Longevity"" by Peter Attia, MD. It provides direction for how we can live a long and healthy life. But it also shares a prescription for the things we need to do if we want to live longer despite the diseases that are out to get us, including cancer, heart disease, and type 2 diabetesAttia is well known for his medical advice on his podcast and in other venues. This book cautions us about what he calls the ""four horsemen"" of diseases that are likely to kill us: heart disease, cancer, neurodegenerative disease, or type 2 diabetes and related metabolic dysfunction. Despite limited progress in holding some of them back, Attia says modern medicine is still not very helpful until a disease is diagnosed before help is provided. ""Someone who drops dead of a heart attack did not just get sick an hour earlier,"" he writes. ""The disease was working inside them, silently and invisibly, for decades. Their internal defense mechanisms weakened as they grew older, and disease gained the upper hand. ""Among the key takeaways from the book:â¢ Current medicine relies on two tactics: procedures (e.g., surgery) and medications. But he suggests that future medicine should focus on five domains: exercise, nutrition, sleep, emotional health, and exogenous molecules, meaning drugs, hormones, or supplements.â¢ According to research by Thomas Perls of Boston University and his colleagues, who run the New England Centenarian Study, one in five people in the general population will have received some type of cancer diagnosis by age seventy-two. Similarly, one-quarter of the general population will have been diagnosed with clinically apparent cardiovascular disease by age seventy-five; among centenarians, that prevalence is reached only at age ninety-two.â¢ When centenarians die, they have generally (though not always) been sick or disabled for a much shorter period than people who died two or three decades earlier.â¢ According to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC), more than 40 percent of the US population is obese (defined as having a BMI[*2] greater than 30), while roughly another third is overweight (BMI of 25 to 30). Statistically, being obese means someone is at greater risk of chronic disease, so a lot of attention is focused on the ""obesity problem,"" but I take a broader view: obesity is merely one symptom of an underlying metabolic derangement, such as hyperinsulinemia, that also happens to cause us to gain weight.â¢ Doctors should focus on metabolical obesity defined in terms of the following five criteria: high blood pressure (>130/85), high triglycerides (>150 mg/dL), low HDL cholesterol (<40 mg/dL in men or <50 mg/dL in women) central adiposity (waist circumference >40 inches in men or >35 in women) elevated fasting glucose (>110 mg/dL)â¢ If you meet three or more of these criteria, you have the metabolic syndromeâalong with as many as 120 million other Americans, according to a 2020 article in JAMA. About 90 percent of the US population ticks at least one of these boxes.â¢ Metabolism is how we take nutrients and break them down for use in the body. Those nutrients are processed and sent to their proper destinations in someone who is metabolically healthy. But when someone is metabolically unhealthy, many calories they consume end up where they are not needed, at bestâor outright harmful, at worst.â¢ Fat also begins to infiltrate your abdomen, accumulating in between your organs.â¢ Patients with diabetes have a much greater risk of cardiovascular disease, cancer, Alzheimer's disease, and other dementias; one could argue that diabetes with related metabolic dysfunction is one thing that all these conditions have in common. ""This is why I place such emphasis on metabolic health and why I have long been concerned about the epidemic of metabolic disease not only in the United States but worldwide.""â¢ Humans have a unique capacity for turning calories from fructose into fat. Lots of people like to demonize fructose, especially in the form of high-fructose corn syrup, without really understanding why it's supposed to be so harmful. The story is complicated but fascinating. The critical factor here is that fructose is metabolized differently from other sugars. When we metabolize fructose, along with certain different types of foods, it produces large amounts of uric acid, best known as a cause of gout but also associated with elevated blood pressure.â¢ Cholesterol is essential to life. It is required to produce some of the most critical structures in the body, including cell membranes; hormones such as testosterone, progesterone, estrogen, and cortisol; and bile acids, which are necessary for digesting food.â¢ The humble egg, in particular, was singled out in a 1968 proclamation by the American Heart Association, accused of causing heart disease because of its high cholesterol content. It has remained in nutritional purgatory for decades, even after reams of research papers showing that dietary cholesterol (and particularly egg consumption) may not have much to do with heart disease at all. Eating lots of saturated fat can increase levels of atherosclerosis-causing lipoproteins in blood, but most of the actual cholesterol that we consume in our food ends up being excreted out our backsides. The vast majority of the cholesterol in our circulation is actually produced by our own cells. Nevertheless, US dietary guidelines warned Americans away from consuming foods high in cholesterol for decades, and nutrition labels still inform American consumers about how much cholesterol is contained in each serving of packaged foods.â¢ cancer is the second leading cause of death in the United States, right behind heart disease. Together, these two conditions account for almost one in every two American deaths. The difference is that we understand the genesis and progression of heart disease fairly well, and we have some effective tools with which to prevent and treat it. As a result, mortality rates from cardiovascular disease and cerebrovascular disease have dropped by two-thirds since the middle of the twentieth century. But cancer still kills Americans at almost exactly the same rate as it did fifty years ago. We have made some progress against a few specific cancers, notably leukemia (especially childhood leukemia, as I noted earlier). For adults with leukemia, ten-year survival rates nearly doubled between 1975 and 2000, leaping from 23 percent to 44 percent. Survival rates for Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphomas have increased as well, especially the former. Yet these represent relatively small victories in a ""war"" that has not gone particularly well.â¢ The problem we face is that once cancer is established, we lack highly effective treatments for it. Our toolbox is limited. Many (though not all) solid tumors can be removed surgically, a tactic that dates back to ancient Egypt. Combining surgery and radiation therapy is pretty effective against most local, solid-tumor cancers. But while we've gotten fairly good at this approach, we have essentially maxed out our ability to treat cancers this way. We are not getting any more juice from the squeeze.â¢ I advocate early, aggressive, and broad screening for my patientsâsuch as colonoscopy (or other colorectal cancer screening) at age forty, as opposed to the standard recommendation of forty-five or fiftyâbecause the evidence is overwhelming that it's much easier to deal with most cancers in their early stages. I am also cautiously optimistic about pairing these tried-and-true staples of cancer screening with emerging methods, such as ""liquid biopsies,"" which can detect trace amounts of cancer-cell DNA via a simple blood test.â¢ Five decades into the war on cancer, it seems clear that no single ""cure"" is likely to be forthcoming. Rather, our best hope likely lies in figuring out better ways to attack cancer on all three of these fronts: prevention, more targeted and effective treatments, and comprehensive and accurate early detection.â¢ But what causes cancer to spread? We don't really know, and we are unlikely to find out anytime soon because only about 5 to 8 percent of US cancer research funding goes to the study of metastasis. Our ability to detect cancer metastasis is also very poor, although I do believe we are on the verge of some key breakthroughs in cancer screening,â¢ Right now, this usually means chemotherapy. Contrary to popular belief, killing cancer cells is actually pretty easy. Traditional chemotherapy occupies a fuzzy region between poison and medicine.â¢ Globally, about 12 to 13 percent of all cancer cases are thought to be attributable to obesity. Obesity itself is strongly associated with thirteen different types of cancers, including pancreatic, esophageal, renal, ovarian, and breast cancers, as well as multiple myeloma (see figure 7). Type 2 diabetes also increases the risk of certain cancers, by as much as double in some cases.â¢ If the first rule of cancer is ""Don't get cancer,"" the second rule is ""Catch it as soon as possible.""â¢ Alzheimer's disease is perhaps the most difficult, most intractable of the Horsemen diseases. We have a much more limited understanding of how and why it begins, and how to slow or prevent it, than we do with atherosclerosis.â¢ While female Alzheimer's patients outnumber men by two to one, the reverse holds true for Lewy body dementia and Parkinson's, both of which are twice as prevalent in men. Yet Parkinson's also appears to progress more rapidly in women than in men, for reasons that are not clear.Finally, the author suggests how medicine needs to change it focus:â¢ The first is exercise, which I consider to be by far the most potent domain in terms of its impact on both lifespan and health span.â¢ Next is diet or nutritionâor as I prefer to call it, nutritional biochemistry.â¢ The third domain is sleep, which has gone underappreciated by Medicine 2.0 until relatively recently.â¢ The fourth domain encompasses a set of tools and techniques to manage and improve emotional health.â¢ Our fifth and final domain consists of the various drugs, supplements, and hormones that doctors learn about in medical school and beyond.",book
"8 Dimensions of Wellness: Physical, EmotionalTake-aways: To avoid the ""Four Horsemen"" (cardiovascular, metabolic, neurodegenerative diseases, and cancer), you can employ several measurable, quantifiable, REALISTIC behavior changes. It covers exercise (but focused on longevity, not ""pretty muscle""), nutrition, medications, and moreYou'll LOVE this book if: you're interested in putting more life into your years, AND years in your life, and making sure your ""Marginal Decade"" isn't bedridden and feeble.DON'T read if: you aren't looking to change your lifestyle, or medical terms turn you away.Reasons I love this book: It's hard to find an author willing to cover all aspects of your physical health. It's even harder to find one who understands the importance of emotional health when it comes to living a fulfilling life. Peter Attia is that author.The book begins by helping the reader understand the causes beyond ""The Four Horsemen,"" and he doesn't simply chalk it up to just genetics. He helps you understand, with sound science and evidence, just what behaviors may be leading you down the path to sickness. He discusses genetics, and their impact as well. And most importantly, he helps the reader understand behaviors that may lead to an early grave.But rather than leaving you in doom and gloom, Dr. Attia paints an optimistic (and refreshingly clear) picture of what behavioral practices to engage in to stave off these dreaded diseases. They include everything from grip strength exercises and stability training, to diet recommendations, and even sleep (think it's too elementary? How have your afternoons been...droggy?)If you're serious about your health, and want to increase your HEALTHSPAN along with your lifespan, this book is for you.Find it on Amazon.

"Allowing common sense (with supplementary googling of issues that are mentioned) to be your guide, there is some value in the book. The author seems to endorse some unqualified views that I would not take literally. If, for instance, you take his exercise endorsements literally, you are apt to damage your joints. If you consume the ""recommended"" amounts of protein for older people, you may retain more lean muscle mass, but you also are consuming an abundance of amino acids that promote growth - - and possibly the growth of cancer cells.As an example of a bizarre exercise recommendation, the author endorses the view that, when rucking, your rucksack contents should ideally be half of your own body weight. Orthopedic websites say that it should not exceed 10% of your body weight. Again, good luck to your joints if you follow this man's advice literally.There is a sense that the author is rather too ""wound up"": He recommends taking a camera and tripod along with you to the gym and filming yourself as you exercise in order to improve. He recommends doing this EVERY DAY. Yes, you actually lug a tripod and camera with you to a gym, every day of your life and film yourself to improve your manner of exercising.Unless you are a medical student, you can safely skip over the numerous paragraphs of detailed physiological process that he describes. Some of the terms that he uses again much later in the book are not defined, as if he assumes the reader has memorized their definitions early on. His intensity evidently carries him away with such blurs of arcane information.The last ""confessional"" chapter adds nothing to the book and, if anything removes whatever credibility the author had built up to that point - - and I suspect that this ""confession"" was included in order to please his family, as if there were no other way of doing that. If I were his editor I'd advise him to drop it in any further printings.Here's what I take from the book:The number one influencer on longevity is exercise. But if you exercise while defying orthopedic injuries (tendons, joints, etc.) you won't be able to exercise at all.If you're older, the author endorses the view that your protein intake should be approximately double that of the traditional recommendations. (This ""double"" recommendation occurs on various medical websites as well, if I remember). That's apparently because older people ""process"" protein less efficiently and because protein helps retain/build lean muscle mass. That, at least, is what I remember reading. BUT there are a number of studies that indicate that higher protein intake of animal-dairy point to a higher incidence of heart disease. Plant protein (I don't know the rate of consumption) seems to be associated with a lower rate of CVD. And high protein intake is not advisable if you have kidney disease. And there is no evidence that higher protein intake will help repair tendons, ligaments/joints. Nor will collagen. And then there are the ""growth"" amino acids that you're consuming in that protein that are associated with disease. So the whole ""higher protein"" recommendation remains vague except for the possibility of helping to heal muscle injuries and for the elderly, to retain lean muscle mass and possibly prevent falls.I look forward to the author's next volume on this subject where he will doubtless revise much of what he's said in a less intense fashion.",book
"The book had lots of great info, most of which was as far as I am aware scientifically valid stuff. However, Ch 13, which discusses stability was unfortunate. It is Based on numerous outdated and extremely weakly substantive thinking. DNS and PRI have been pretty well debunked by most well informed fitness professionals. There are some decent thoughts about breathing but to the ideas on patterns and development models as keys â¦ these arguments are nothing more than specious and extremely weakly supported not to mention lacking in replication. This type of guru based fitness should have no foothold in a legit scientific based book. Itâs understandable however as the author seems to have had real success with these techniques, however as many in fields such as pain science have noted, there are a great number of ways to interphase with the sympathetic nervous system to create symptom modification and get people moving again. I highly recommend checking out the works of Greg Lehman, Peter OâSullivan, or Todd Hargrove (he has some great books on these topics!). Many roads to Rome, and often the thing that modulates symptoms is not modulating them because of the story told by the guru. âThe outcome of the intervention does not justify the theory for why the intervention worked.â You donât need DNS and you donât need PRI, you likely need load/stressor management, variability, and mindful movement.Other than that, the rest of the book seems deeply thoughtful and science informed.",book
"Favorite Quote: Perhaps my biggest takeaway was that modern medicine does not really have a handle on when and how to treat the chronic diseases of aging that will likely kill most of us.Synopsis: Outlive by Dr. Peter Attia is one of the best books on health and wellness Iâve ever read. Attiaâs principle goal is to show readers that we are on a precipice: continue on our path as we have in the last 50 years and, as a whole, suffer more from cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and neurodegenerative disease, or move past treating symptoms once theyâve arrived and focus on preventative measures to help us age without these diseases.Bold premise? Yes. Accomplished? Also, yes.Over the course of 4oo pages, Attia details what we face as we get older: The Four Horsemen - perhaps not the four horsemen of the apocalypse from lore, but the new Four Horsemen of the Health Apocalypse. As cancer rates rise, so too, do cases of neurodegenerative diseases (like Alzheimerâs), Type 2 Diabetes (and other metabolic dysfunctions), and heart disease. The problem, Attia presents, is that these diseases are not acute - meaning that they take decades to develop. While someone may have a sudden heart attack, the mechanisms to create the environment that caused the heart attack have been brewing for years.This is where Attia pushes for the move from Medicine 2.0 to Medicine 3.0. Currently, we are living primarily in the world of Medicine 2.0 - treating symptoms and focusing on the present, not what our health could look like in 10, 20, or 30 years. Medicine 3.0, however, should begin as soon as we become aware of it - or sooner. Medicine 3.0 wants humans to avoid the Four Horsemen by using exercise, nutritional biochemistry (not diet - he discusses why in the book), and emotional well-being to set us up for living to age 100 and beyond.Why does this book beguile? Written by a doctor, Outlive by Peter Attia, pushes the boundaries of whatâs typically acceptable in medicine today. He acknowledges how challenging it may be to get a DEXA scan from your doctor, and shares why you arenât receiving proper nutritional advice from your primary provider. Attia hits on so many things in the medical system today that frustrate me: poor tracking of health metrics, treating symptoms and not causes, little to no specialized nutritional advice, and a pill-for-everything instead of viewing a patient holistically.Until the medical system, and more importantly, the medical insurance system catches up to Medicine 3.0 (which is probably less profitable than Medicine 2.0), those interested in longevity and preventative measures, may live in the nebulous realm of what I call, Medicine 2.75. Medicine 2.75 is where the patient, like you and me, must take our health into our own hands. Using tools like Everly Well and Empowered DX Labs, you can purchase your own at-home testing kits to monitor whatâs important to you. You may have to find a more forward-thinking primary care provider to help order the right tests and scans and then take your nutrition into your own hands. Itâs quite a bit of work for the average person, but well worth it to live long and enjoyable lives.",book
"This book is fantastic. Anyone with an interest in learning how to live a healthier, longer life should buy a copy and study it. Thatâs what I did. After reading it I ordered a second copy and gave it to my primary care physician because I wanted him to know where I was coming from in terms of being a patient and how I want to live my life. Outlive, is a goldmine of healthcare information.I became aware of Peter Attia about five years ago when a friend suggested I listen to an episode of The Drive. For those who are unfamiliar with Attia, this is his weekly podcast. After listening to it I was hooked and immediately became a subscriber and began listening to archived episodes. I spend a lot of time commuting and to date Iâve probably listened to two-thirds of the interviews and the Ask Me Anything discussions. So when I received the notification that his long-awaited book was finally going to be published I preordered my copy. Once it arrived I got out my pen and highlighter and went to work.I believe I can speak from a position of strength when it comes to commenting on this book. I have walked a similar career path. Like Attia, Iâve been trained in basic science research. I earned a PhD under the mentorship of the great Philip Gollnick, PhD, one of the pioneers of modern exercise science. Similar to Attia, Iâve also been trained in medicine and surgery having completed a medical degree and a surgical residency in orthopedics.Attia is a voice in the wilderness shouting the message of Medicine 3.0, a philosophy based on the guiding principles of preventing the onset of chronic disease. He defines the time from birth to the onset of chronic disease as healthspan. The period of time from birth to death is lifespan. The goal of Medicine 3.0 is to increase healthspan so that it encompasses most, if not all, of lifespan. Medicine 3.0 is proactive whereas Medicine 2.0 (where we are now) is reactive. Medicine 2.0 begins treatment of an illness or disease only after it has been diagnosed, after the damage has begun. Medicine 3.0 is based on preventing, or delaying, the onset of disease or illness so that treatment is avoided.How does Attia recommend we go about maximizing healthspan? He believes this can be accomplished by focusing on doing everything possible to prevent what he terms, the four horsemen: metabolic syndrome (type-2 diabetes), cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimerâs, Parkinsonâs, etc.). The book is broken up into sections devoted to each of the horsemen. A final section, where Attia opens up and presents some of his personal journey, is devoted to emotional health. The importance of this section cannot be overstated. Emotional health probably should be considered the fifth horseman (but that would wreck the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse metaphor).He focuses on ways to prevent cognitive decline, the slowing of our mental processing speed as we age. An emphasis is placed on exercise, aerobic and strength training, as an intervention. Exercise increases cardiovascular and respiratory function and decreases the loss of muscle size and strength. It also increases bone density and deceases osteopenia and osteoporosis. In short, regular exercise reduces frailty. As frailty increases our risk of mortality increases. He makes the claim that the single most important thing anyone can do to improve healthspan is to exercise on a regular basis. It is better than any drug you can take (with the possible exception of rapamycin), nutrient, or diet.Attia and his co-author Bill Gifford tone down the technical aspects of some of the medical topics to make it more accessible to a lay audience. However, this does not detract from the quality of the information. If anything it makes the book better by reaching a broader audience. If a reader wants more detailed information on a topic they can easily obtain it by culling through the archives of The Drive where in depth interviews with preeminent physicians and scientists are available. He employs a team of highly skilled analysts that are constantly reading the latest scientific publications looking for high-quality research pertinent to his mission. He is at the forefront of Medicine 3.0.If you want to learn more about your physical and emotional health with the goal of living better and longer then read Outlive, the Science & Art of Longevity.",book
"Dr. Peter Attia is the real deal. I find everything he says inspiring and useful. He is the speaker on the audible version, which is excellent also. He does not talk down to you. Every time I open the book or listen to a chapter I say to myself that I should listen to at least one chapter a day to not only educate myself but to get and stay motivated toward living a healthy life. I can't image not loving this book.",book
"I normally donât write product reviews but after I read the few one- and two-star reviews describing the book as fluff I could not control my fingers! What?? Are you kidding me? To paraphrase senator Lloyd Bentsen, I know âfluffâ and my friends this book is no fluff. Rather, to say that this amazing book is by far and away at the top of its genre is an understatement. I write this as I embark on a second reading of âOutliveâ, having read it once almost in one setting, skipping a couple of exercise sessions no less. Attia clearly possesses the intellect, integrity, wit, vigor, candor, and God knows what else that went into the making of this amazing mind and person. Everyone will experience the book from his special angle, based on background and knowledge, but no one will leave empty handed. As an eye surgeon, professor, and author of several books myself, I can say that I so thoroughly enjoyed this book and will be sharing it with my friends and family and recommending it to patients and colleagues. Attiaâs content is a favorite discussion topic with my children: podcast, emails, and finally the book, and sometimes my son or daughter would wonder aloud âwhat do you think is Attiaâs position on this?â.So what if I, as a moslem, will be âaddingâ a final chapter to the book, so as to discuss it within my circle, that imparts a transcendental framework to our quest for a long life beyond the raising of a strong healthy physical horse. If you believe that your existence totally ends with death, it makes perfect sense to embark on a quest to lengthen your life, beyond which there is nothing. But if you belief as I do that there is an eternal component to our essence that continues beyond the entombment of our bodies, then your horizon and end point is limitless. Is the martyr who died defending his people and his family against oppression and tyranny at age 20, achieving a dismal Attia-style longevity, a loser, a tragic figure who fell victim to unfortunate conflicts, or is he worth a thousand longevity-focused horses? To exclusively pamper the animal (body) and ignore the horseman (soul) is to put the cart before the horse. In addition, to preach that we should persevere in trying to lengthen life a few more years, and spend a whole lifetime doing it, strikes me as wasting your life in order to lengthen it.My advice to friends and family is this: Go ahead and double click on exercise and nutrition; huff and buff to raise your VO2 max, and be stable with firm resolve as you prioritize DNS. But do bear in mind that you are making the horse strong to serve the horseman, and not the other way around. We are not mere shells: eat, move, sleep, copulate, repeat. Get yourself a more spacious framework. Be in control as your phosphorylated spirit commandeer the horse so that the both of you can stand, marsh, live, and die with nobility and honor. âOutlivingâ to me is a transcendent term, to outdo and go beyond the bounds of your biological carbon-based body, to achieve escape velocity through a noble righteous life on Earth that propels your soul to heaven when biology fails you, so as to justify the reason that God commanded the angels to bow to Adam.Of course, this is not a book about religion, and of course we agree less on religion than we do nutrition, and of course moslems are a zealot punch (attempt at self-deprecating humor), and of course as a physician I would love to read the 2000 page version (sorry, Penguin Random House). But from my perspective this is a beautifully written book by an author that I and my kids grew to love and admire, one who does not do anything half-way. Read it and reread it but put the material to practice by moving a good amount in between reading spurts.",book
"I have been an ER nurse for 20 years and have seen firsthand the last decade (or two or three) that he speaks of. Countless visits for chronic medical problems, pain and discomfort. The medical system has been overwhelmed for YEARS and is only getting worse. I urge EVERYONE to read this as a guide to living better, spending less time at medical appointments and living a quality life!!! I know there are some fairly technical parts- especially if you are not in medicine- and the author admits that it is long, but SO WORTH THE READð",book
"It's impossible to overstate the necessity of this book, especially at a time when the conflict between Israel and the Palestinian people has reached a fever pitch. I write this as Israel continues her indiscrimminant bombing of Gazan civilians in brutal retaliation for crimes the citizens didn't commit, and at a time where settler violence in the West Bank is also at a fever pitch. As I type in early November 2023, already nearly 10,000 Palestinians have been senselessly slaughtered by the Israeli government for the terrorist actions of Hamas.This book cuts through all the misinformation and propaganda, both in the West and in the Middle East to highlight and grant a voice and platform to history's most forgotten people.Everyone who stands for something will find a reason to stand for the Palestinian people--not a government, not a terrorist organisation, only the Palestinian people who have been the collective punching bag of various geopolitical interests. No more.Very well-researched, well-sourced, and well-written, this is the book Palestinians deserve. Few books inspire the heart like this one. Thank you, Mr. Khalidi, for lighting this small reader's candle with the light of truth and compassion.May that same light inspire others.",book
"The horrific Hamas attack on the Israelis and the planned attack on Gaza by Israel is best understood by looking at the history of the creation of Israel and the resulting displacement and disregard of the Palestinians living there. This is a well-written and even-handed description of that history. The land, possessions and rights of the Palestinians were taken away by Israel with the help of Britain, the Arab states, and the United States. Israel's disregard of the lives of civilians in many instances, with the help and involvement of the United States, especially Henry Kissinger and Alexander Haig, are as awful as the actions Hamas if we believe that all people are equal and all civilians should be protected. The United States has never been, and is not now, a neutral party that seeks peace. Unfortunately, the term ""anti-semitic"" is used against those that simply want the Palestinians to have a voice. A true two-state solution with an independent and free Palestinian state, and the recognition of Israel's right to exist is the only solution. This book should be read by all who have grown up with a one-sided view of the Israeli -Palestinian issues.",book
"I was afraid of this, a of bunch troll hit reviews within the last few days. Some disingenuous reviews claim they didn't know anything about the conflict and it's somehow bad/ biased. There will be more. Instead, it's a careful study that engages with the ideas of settler colonialism in Palestine and lays out the case carefully and uses his own family history to anchor what he argues.Whether you agree with the conclusions, is your own choice. But, it's a careful walk through history done well and uses his family as a frame. If you want to genuinely know how the history looks from a great scholarly study from a Palestinian historian and voice--this is the book you want.",book
"This book is required reading to get the real history of the formation of Israel and the ethnic cleansing of Palestinians, which is happening to this day.",book
"A historical, factual and broad look at the colonial aspects of the formation of Israel by the literal and figurative displacement of the Palestinian people. Must read for anyone who wants to get a first understanding of war on the Palestinians.",book

Amazing history. Definitely recommend if your looking to understand the conflict in Palestine better.,book
"This short book is rather ambitious in the sense that it sums up the history of the conflicts in Israel/Palestine in just over 250 pages. So inevitably, Khalidi left out certain details. His assessment of the history of the conflict is in a way predictable, as he portrays Zionism as nothing but a colonial movement and he blames Britain and then the US for propping up Israel as if it had been a victim of persecution by the Arabs. There are some puzzling omissions, as he does not talk much about the real motives of the Arab nations in the wake of the collapse of the Ottoman Empire. The Hashemite kingdomâs role in early Jewish immigration cannot be ignored in this history, but he does not touch this thorny issue. The big surprise is the almost total omission of the Yom Kippur War. Although Khalidi did experience Israeli violence in Lebanon personally, he doesnât sound like someone in close touch with the people actually there, especially in Gaza. That is indeed the problem of the PLO or the Fatah, by his own admission, that they were out of touch. As I always got an impression that they were playing a cynical power game, by deliberating placing the Palestinians in harms way so that they could counter the Israeli narrative of national victimhood. But Khalidi, though admitting this problem, does not explore the politics of the PLO leadership deeply enough. Hamas needs to be examined more in detail, but perhaps he is not so well informed? At least, this book serves as a good summary of the conflict from a Palestinian perspective, though personally, I would like to hear the voices of those who actually live in Gaza or the West Bank. Undoubtedly, the best part of the book is the final chapter, in which he explains how US policy worked and how the Palestinians have consistently failed to influence the US (i.e., they were always outwitted and outsmarted by the Israelis). He almost sounds more like a liberal American than a Palestinian. His proposed course of action for the Palestinian leaders are sound, but also too academic, which would be difficult to implement, unfortunately.",book
"I am someone who knew virtually nothing about the Israeli-Palestinian conflict so, I went looking for history books to help explain where it started. Israeli books were plentiful and did not pick one side or the other, which was a tremendous help in trying to understand each sideâs perspective. Saw this book and I wasnât sure to expect. There werenât that many to pick from and as I suspected, it was 300 page rant. By page 7, heâs criticizing all Europeans and I could see regardless of his resume, he couldnât be trusted as a source for new learners.",book
"Until reading Professor Rashid Khalidi's book, I had (and still have) inadequate knowledge about this small piece of land called by some the Land of Israel and called by others the Land of Palestine.Professor Khalidi skips the hard edge blame game to relate his own family's experiences over the century when Zionism took shape and took control .His research from the late 1800s, the Basel Conference of 1897, the support Hertzl, Weissman and Ben-Gurion amalgamated for the creation of Israel is well known to me and many others . I was not aware of the indigenous Palestinian inept organizing and inept leadership during the five decades of the groundwork that created the modern State of Israel. This ineptitude continues today as Fatah and Hamas are unable to work together for the betterment of the Palestinian people.Even with inept Palestinian leadership, world opinion has tilted to support for the underdog Palestinian people..Professor Khalidi does not present a solution to the conflict.... Other than to pose and awaken that the 8 million Jews and 4 million Palestinians need to embrace the today reality that neither group is going away. Both the Jews and the Palestinians share this small piece of land today, tomorrow and years and decades to come.....",book

The story line of this book is very confusing and hard to understand/follow for young children.,book
"This is a sweet, thoughtful book about various activities and sentiments relating to Thanksgiving (many different types of families and people are represented, too). Everything from serving others at a soup kitchen to watching the Macy's parade to going on a hay ride to enjoying being with family is represented.

"Since Amazon wonât allow customers to review their fulfillment and delivery separately from the product this is broken into two parts.The Books:Amazing. Sexy. Stunning.If youâre a fan of fantasy genre anything, Iâd be willing to bet youâll like these. I love the characters, the world building, the lore, the smutâ¦ everything. The reading flows so easily youâll be amazed how fast you can devour these. My only complaint is that there arenât more of these books yet, and that I donât understand what a âsnarlâ is supposed to look like half the time the word is used.The Fulfillment by Amazon:Bad. Not sexy. Horrible.I ordered this box set FIVE times. The first two times I ordered paperback box sets, they came to me scratched/torn/dirty. I chalked it up to the paperbacks being a little âweakerâ and decided to spring for the hardcovers after returning.The first hardcover delivery was awful, the box was actually broken and splitting along the bottom. The second hardcover delivery one of the books was damaged due to one of the corner being pushed in so far. Third order was the charm and they finally got it right.The Moral of The Story:Read these books, but be prepared to return your box set 3-4 times.

As for the series, the only thing I wish is that there would be more about Azriel, a redemption arc for Tamlin, resolve for Lucien and hopefully mates be revealed for Az, Mor, Elain, Tamlin and Lucien.. who knows, maybe the next book will answer some of these questions.

The headband on the fourth book was folded down and missing part of it and the end pages were also folded.

I am seriously very picky on what do I spend my time on , but this one definitely made me chuckle, laugh, cry and feel every emotion a reader can feel ha ! Very unpopular opinion: I absolutely hate the second half on the first book and I almost gave up on the series, but I hate leaving things unfinished, and I am so glad I stuck with it. Second book was an absolute gift and I could literally not go on with my life , I had to quit everyday tasks to keep on reading , to see whatâs happening next .Definitely a page turner. Loved the writing, the plot, the story , honestly just all of it.",book
"I am so glad that I got the box set! I was able to read the Feyre, pronounced fay-ruh, stories at my pace. The set also gave me the hardcovers I wanted.Wow! Calling everyone who likes fairy tales with sex and violence among immortals, this set is a great buy. The novels are extremely addictive. All I can say is, enjoy!",book
"I was so excited when this showed up. And showed up quickly! ð I was not disappointed, they were well handled and no bangs or damage to the books! Loved adding them to my collection. Wish the books themselves were a little ""floppier"" (book readers will understand), but overall I'm completely satisfied with my purchase!",book
"I was boycotting this series for a while because of how hyped up it is, but oh boy is it worth it. This book series is the type of book series that gets a person that doesnât read to fall in love with reading. The second book was my absolutely favorite of the 5 books. If you like fantasy and romance you should give this series a shot!",book
"I am so glad I got the boxed set, because I didn't have to wait! I could not put these books down and I am so glad I purchased them.This was the start of my adult reading and now overwhelming book collection.The series has a little bit of everything - love, war, spying, sabotage, mind games, strategy, even more romance. 10/10 Just wish I could read them for the first time again.",book
Uses good imagery and wording. My 4 year old loves this book. It's not difficult or over saturated with items. The last page to find the real bluey was fun for my daughter and I.,book
"We both enjoyed it over and over. She is almost 4, and some things were easy for her, others harder. Later I saw a note in the back of the book there was a hidden weenie dog in each picture. Weâd like more books like this one!",book
"This keeps my kids busy for hours! Itâs like a kids version of whereâs Waldo. There are references images for kids to try to find a match for. If they are a bit older and the memorized where the images are, you can describe different characters to find. Weâll worth its money.",book
My daughter loves that all the characters from the show are featured throughout the book! There are 14 scenes to find a handful of images. Each scene is a location familiar to Bluey fans but would be enjoyable for a child who hasn't seen the show as well. The pages are a thicker quality so we treat this activity book like a book and keep it on the book shelf for continual use. Since each scene only has 8-12 items to find there's no need to cross out or circle the hidden object. It's easy enough to keep track of what you have found and what still needs to be found. This also allows the book to be shared between children or played with over and over if nothing is marked on the pages. In typical Bluey fun the scenes are snapshot of a moment where the characters are interacting and being silly! Answer key in back of book if you get stumped! Highly recommend!,book
This book was perfect for my 5 year old. She loves to show me how she can find everything on her own!,book
"I purchased this seek and find for my 2 Littles who just got into them. They are 3y and 5y. This book has busy scenes pictured with their favorite Bluey characters. The objects to find are listed with a picture of what they look like which is definitely a good thing. They are pretty challenging, even for my husband and myself. Probably better for older than 5y olds but my kids have fun with it anyway. Once they pretty much had the objects memorized, we started just playing ""eye spy"" with the book as the pictures have plenty of content to ""spy"".",book
"I got this for my grandsons because I thought it would be a fun way to keep them busy on airplane. They both love bluey, and this book is super cute and just the perfect level for them (ages two and four) for search and find items on each page. It has really nice illustrations and just a cute overall book. My only complaint would be that it is sized like a coloring book, so a little bit of an awkward size for little hands and the cover is not very sturdy.",book
Present for my grand babyThank u,book
A great book for fans of bluey. Bought this for a one year old bluey fan.,book
Make sure you read the description and reviews! This is PAPERBACK not a hard cover. But itâs good quality and such a cute book. My niece and nephew love it and it has the answers at the back!,book

Bought as a gift. Child loved it.,book
"I loved reading this book! I have a disability and it has been my belief that so many people miss the great things I can bring to the table. Ultimately, by finding the value in everyone, we all get better.The challenge I had was with the study that talked about high school students and where they would be 10 years later. Struggle can happen at any point in someone's life (including as a sophomore or junior in high school). As I read this section, I caught myself wondering if those later struggles were brought into consideration. I wanted to believe that you were pointing to the possibility of success later and yet missed the mark. I left that section feeling like high school mattered when, in reality, what matters is overcoming one's own personal challenges.",book
"I enjoyed this book because Grant stresses that we all have potential, often far more than we realize. Too often we become frustrated when we fail to learn something new easily or when our progress seems stymied. Yet that is part of the natural process of learning.I also like how he wrote about using your knowledge even if it is not yet perfect. Students learning a second language, for example, should be experimenting in the wild and getting corrected as much as possible. When I was learning Spanish in Costa Rica many years ago, I noticed the students who spent most of their time socializing outperformed those of us who dutifully did our homework each night.In short, this book is an inspiring, enjoyable, and worthwhile read.",book
"Dr. Grant has provided the reader robust research and case study outlining why we should also believe in self. It isn't about your intellect, it's about character. If we can develop good character and pro social skills, there are no limits what each of us can achieve. We all to often discard people because we categorize them based on race, gender, economic status, and a whole host of other boxes to check. We seldom allow individuals to show you their character and the obstacles they've successfully navigated to get where they are today. Let's stop missing these opportunities and let's look for the hidden potential in all of us.",book
My favorite of all of Adam Grant's books...and I didn't know that would be possible after Think Again! So much to learn about how to bring out the best in ourselves and others. I will definitely be reading this one over and over again.,book
Malcolm Gladwell said it best: âThis is Adam Grantâs finest work.â I can think of a list of people I want to give this book to. A must read!,book
What a great inspirational book by Adam. Building character skills is the key to success and your hidden potential. Donât be afraid of discomfort.,book
Just a pleasure to read!!Thumbs up!!!!!!!!!!,book
"You can tell Adam Grant takes his work seriously and is passionate about his topic. This book is an encouraging review of concepts and examples that show how success can be built from varied and difficult circumstances. My only criticism is that section two - creating structures to sustain motivation and momentum - falls short in consideration of the various starting points (beyond social and cultural circumstances) that change how individuals will be positioned in better or worse ways on their journey. There is a hope here to start with a level of academic rigor that few popular books attain, and then build on those with reflections and interpretations. That is refreshing and admirable to be sure, but misses one important issue: the means for ranking and rating studies and other research suffer from some of the same limitations as the selection processes he highlights in part 3. I donât mean this to be a harsh criticism, as Grant shows both commitment and passion that are beyond the vast majority of authors. Heâs very intent on making the world a better place with his work and this book embodies that. Recommended.",book
"Adam Grant goes into why we should be celebrating when our school children make errors as they progress and grow. I was not as interested in the correlation with kindergarten teachers and adult income as I was with the illustration of how many times you have to have an arrow not hit the bullseye in order to learn archery. I benefited from going to Montessori and engaging in self-directed learning. I love the idea of finding the perfect way to give feedback and coach for growth. He has a crisp list of recommendations at the end of the book which is worth reviewing. Iâm not sure if Adam Grantâs newest book will be cited as much as Carol Dweckâs, but I know that it certainly should be.",book
"Adam Grant is an amazing storyteller, and ""Hidden Potential"" is all the more captivating if you listen to the audible version with its cast of characters. Grantâs bestselling book is an empowering read that resonates with people of all backgrounds. Through his moving stories, Grant skillfully connects with readers on an emotional level, allowing us to see ourselves in the experiences of others. Iâm sure I wasnât the only one to get choked up at the end of each chapter.There were so many powerful âAdam Grant quotes"" woven throughout the chapters that will now become the pillars I can rely on and live by to maximize my potential. From the power of being a sponge, to the importance of being resilient, and persevering, and finding ways to manage discomfort, forever adapting, building scaffolding, and diamonds in the rough. ""The test of a diamond in the rough is not whether it shines from the start, but how it responds to heat or pressure.â Heat and pressure. A life filled with way too much heat and pressure is likely the reason I found ""Hidden Potential"" to be such a profound statement about all that isnât, and all that could be if we just adjusted our lenses. Hidden Potential made me realize that so many negative extreme life struggles have a great amount of positive value after all. HIGHLY recommend ""Hidden Potential, The Science of Achieving Greater Things"", and canât help but believe that this life-altering, and potentially culture-altering, read is destined for a prized award!",book
"I just adore Lucy Score-the charm of her writing, the humor, the endearing characters and delicious chemistry. And add in CHRISTMAS!!? I'm a goner. And I just adored this lovable story. Enemies to lovers, forced collaboration, and so much adorable banter and sexual tension. Cat and Noah are delightful together. The dialogue is witty and clever, the whole fixer upper premise is loads of fun and so unique, and the emotional layers just keep unravelling for a really beautiful story underneath all the fire and sass. Cat is a heroine you root for, and Noah is the character you FALL for. Their relationship (and Noah's backstory) had me ALL in my feels. Lucy always weaves emotional complexity so effortlessly into her stories, and this one had me ALL up in my feelings. And the spice! These two are electric together- the push-pull between them was epic. Not to mention we had a great dose of Christmas running throughout. If you're looking for a heartfelt, tender, but fun and humorous Christmas romance, the Christmas Fix is a complete delight. Definitely a favorite from Lucy Score and a top holiday read!",book
"This book could easily be a hallmark movie! I havenât read mr. Fixer upper (the first in this diet) and overall it didnât make a difference although I could definitely tell at the beginning that it was not the first book on a series. Cat is so much fun. Sheâs a work hard, like really hard, occasionally play hard hgtv esque reality star and contractor set on saving the town of Merryâs Christmas despite âMr. Noâ Noahâs reluctance. Not going to lie it took a long time for me to warm up to Noah, he is far too judgy of Cat at first but once they move past that itâs a sweet romance. My favorite part of the whole story was that a thing the town of Merry come together after a hurricane wrecked the place. Having lived through a hurricane flood (not going to lie, the beginning set off my flooding ptsd a little) I really felt for the town and love getting to see Cat and her crew bring the buildings back to life. Overall this was a sweet and spicy enemies to lovers full of Christmas spirit!",book
"This book is a bit of a departure for the author. Usually she features a macho, take-charge, bossy guy and an insecure but smart woman. In this case, the heroine is the smart, outspoken one. She is pitted against a sweet, gentle man. I really liked this.However, once they get together, the author goes back to her usual take-charge, bossy guy, and I didn't like him as well.The book is well-written, and it was also a Christmas-themed story. (I'm a sucker for a Christmas book.)I just wish the male could have remained sweet and tender throughout.",book
"If I could give this book 10 stars I would. I adore Cat and the town of Merry, well I would move there in a Texas minute.",book
The typical Lucy formula. Still keeps me reading and emotionally invested. She really makes you love the people in every book.,book
"If youâve read Mr. Fixer Upper (and if you havenât, what on earth are you waiting for?!?!), you probably already love Cat King. I know I did. As soon as I finished Mr. Fixer Upper, I had a list of characters I was hoping for more from. Cat was at the top. She was so full of life. She worked hard and played just as hard. She stood up for what she believed in. She was a great friend and loved her family dearly. How much more could you ask for in a character? I loved Cat King.So, Lucy Score is fantastic. She heard the outcry of her fans and the whispers (okay, itâs Cat...they were probably shouts) from Cat, and The Christmas Fix was born. Okay, Iâm not positive exactly how this happened, but this is how I like to imagine it. Either way, Lucy gave us The Christmas Fix, an amazing enemies-to-lovers Christmas story, and it is perfect. I thought I loved Cat King before, but now I am completely enamored. I am in awe of this woman. Everything I liked about her before is magnified by a million, but there is also this other side to her that we didnât get to see in Mr. Fixer Upper. This side that loves so hard, cares so deeply, and turns to mush only at the most perfect of moments. She is a complete and total rockstar. She still stands up for womenâs rights, works herself harder than anyone else, and enjoys having a good time, but watching her fall in love is truly something special.And Noah, oh Noah. Noah may seem like a complete jerk in the beginning (remember, this is enemies-to-lovers, and I already loved Cat), but there is just something about him. He is so noble. Even when he is completely wrong, he has good intentions. He is a good, sensible guy who loves his daughter and his town. He wants to protect both from anything that could harm them. Unfortunately, he believes Cat King falls into that category. However, Cat being Cat is determined to prove him wrong. As the story unfolds, you fall further and further in love with Noah.I absolutely love these two together. The balance they found with one another was incredible. Noah needs Cat to bring him out of his shell and really live. He needs her to show him what fun really is. And Noah is the stability and steadfast support Cat needs in her crazy life. And the chemistry, oh my goodness the chemistry. These two are completely off the charts. Their banter is fantastic. Cat says what she thinks and doesnât hold back which causes (and/or ends) some fantastic arguments. And their love is even more explosive than their hate. While you have to wait for them to get there, it is completely worth it! The tension builds until it boils over in perfection.What more could you want, right? Well, in true Lucy Score fashion, this book brings all the feels. The town of Merry really becomes a character of its own with the wonderful people and traditions it holds dear. Watching the town come together in this time of need is amazing. The residents are unique and wonderful. The way they support one another is heartwarming. The way they take in Cat and her crew is extraordinary. I seriously want to move there...who wouldnât?This book was beautifully written. The symbolism is subtle and truly amazing, the characters are so real and complex, and seriously all the feels are there without it being over the top. There are very few authors that can include humor, love, witty banter, and so much emotion in the same book naturally, but this book truly has it all. I canât recommend it enough.What are you still doing here? Put your time to good use and one click now! This is a book you donât want to miss!",book
Such a great story! Lucy you do such an awesome job of keeping it real and believable. I read for escape from the craziness of this world. Noah and Cat definitely gave me that! Write faster Lucyâ¦Iâve read almost all of your books!,book
"I love this book. I read this book every year around the holidays. Lucy Score is one of the few authors I read that writes mostly in third person. I prefer reading first person, dual point of view, but the way Lucy writes, it doesn't bother me. The story is so good and so well written that I don't struggle to follow our feel confused.Noah is the manager of the small town of Merry, Connecticut. A town that was destroyed after a a bad storm, leaving property damage by wind and rain. He's up tight, needs to be in control of everything in his life and has earned the nickname, Mr. No. Cat is general contractor who stars in a home makeover TV show. She had done a home in Merry, so when the town was hit by that devastating storm, she felt the need to go back and help in any way she could. That led to her coming up with an idea to restore as much of the town as possible, while filming it for the show. This way, the town could get the help it needed and her show would also benefit in paid advertising and ratings. Noah was not receptive to this and fought her every step of the way. They butted heads until their arguing led to a heated make out session. Soon they were sneaking around together and learning that they both had the same agenda for the town. What started as hate, turned into lust and eventually turned into love. Knowing that Noah could never leave his home as he was co-parenting, Cat has to decide if she can figure out a way to be with Noah and possibly give up her lifestyle of moving around the country, rehabbing homes.This is such a great story and I absolutely love Noah and Cat. They are both such strong capable people, so different but so right for each other. This is a funny and steamy love story and as I mentioned above, I love it so much, that I re-read it every year. Highly recommend.Bookstagrambrielle",book
Addicted to Lucy Score. I am on a mission to read all her books!,book
Fabulous story with the best characters. Loved the town that needed rescuing and when everyone jumped in to help each other . Perfect! The kids are too stinking perfect!,book
My grandson never used them. He was home schooled and was not a good reader. I think this would make a difference. His mother put it on the shelf. I think it was an excellent tool for learning,book

"MY DAUGHTER IS TWO YEARS OLD. We started this week and from memory recall she already knows 19 sight words. Out, Many, Look, But, Did, Had, When, by, some, like, at, he, am, that, for, see, is, a, I. I taught her ones that may frequently appear in books and the ones that can start off sentences as we also practice sentence building. I also got creative and added her old flashcards in to make longer sentences.UPDATE: itâs now Sept 30 and she knows 32 sight words I love these cards!",book

"The Shadow-Work Journal is nothing short of a masterpiece in self-discovery and personal growth. This journal has profoundly impacted my life, and I'm thrilled to share my experience with it!The concept of shadow work has always intrigued me, and this journal is the perfect companion on that inward journey. It provides insightful prompts and exercises that encourage you to explore the depths of your psyche, helping you confront and embrace the hidden aspects of yourself. The self-awareness gained through this process is invaluable.The Shadow-Work Journal feels like a safe, non-judgmental confidant.

"Okay..I didnât expect to gain much from this journal because I already do a lot of self reflecting but it had me thinking about things Iâd never thought about before. I was cynical at first, but trust me me it makes you dig deep and analyze what makes you the way you are today. I had a great childhood, but this does in fact tap in to areas I didnât know I needed to even address with myself. 10/10 recommend to everyone!!!",book
"This journal opens up deep triggers and truths about why you are the way you are. If you struggle with severe depression, please talk to a therapist before starting this journal as it opens up some deep wounds and childhood traumas.

It hurts your feelings. It makes you more aware of your habits and triggers. Itâs very deep.",book
"My son asked me to purchase this book for him while he was away in college. He says he loves this book. I gave him a lot to write about and think about.

"I read this story to my students near Thanksgiving, and it taught them a lot of good vocabulary for the holiday. It was really great for helping them describe items, as well as sequence events. It kept them engaged and entertained throughout. The repetitive phrases had them reading along by the end of the story. I would recommend this book to anything who reads to children!",book
Cute story. My preschoolers loved it. ð,book
I read this to my 3rd graders at Thanksgiving time,book
"I bought this book since the kids and I enjoyed the ""The Was an Old Lady Who Swallowed a Bat"" book. But this one was not a hit for any of us. The rhymes were odd and there was no humor in it like the others. Also, this one is paperback, and the toddler ripped a page early on trying to turn it, so it became trash.",book
I read this to my little niece and she loved it!,book
Kids like these books and it is easy reading,book

Great story! Kids loved it!,book

"One of the conclusions I reached early in my life is that there is a huge disconnect between so called ""conventional wisdom"" in most important areas of life and what actually works in real life as shown for example in the difference between being an A-list celebrity and ranking high in the Forbes' list of wealthiest individuals.Elon Musk's life, that Walter Isaacson documents in this book, is a prime example of this disconnect.If you go by standard advice about what it takes to get admitted into one of America's top schools, there is no way that in 2023 a white kid without connections who grew up in a somehow privileged background -upper middle class in segregated South Africa- who scores 1400 (V670, Q730) in the SAT in his second try would be offered admission at any of America's top universities. And yet, this what Elon Musk looked like on paper circa 1992 when he applied as transfer student to the University of Pennsylvania. Luckily for the United States, admission committees at America's top schools 30 years ago were more rational than their contemporary counterparts. Elon Musk gained admission to the University of Pennsylvania and the rest, as they say, is history.My path crossed with Elon Musk's at the Stanford seminar mentioned at the beginning of chapter 20 of the book. Back then I was a nervous young professional who had just submitted his application for graduate study at Stanford praying that I would get in. I recall two things distinctively from that talk: 1) Elon's telling that he had dropped out of Stanford to start his first company -I told myself that I would not be as silly if I got in-, 2) that he told the audience during the QA that he didn't think a particular degree or life experience prepared someone better than others to become a successful entrepreneur. Both ideas went against the standard advice I had heard from other speakers at the Entrepreneurial Thought Leaders seminar and, unimpressed, I didn't go to say hello to Elon Musk at the end of the talk. In the book I learn that it's in that seminar that Jeffrey Straubel approached Elon for an investment in Tesla.I have gone back many times in my mind to that October 2003 talk since Elon Musk began to be recognized for his genius in Silicon Valley circles (late 2000s, early 2010s).It is often said that a person's character is forged during a person's childhood and teen years. The biggest insight I am getting from Walter Isaacson's book is that Elon Musk's were the exact opposite of what experts in child and teen development say what those years should be like.I get that Elon Musk is a controversial personality with some. At the same time, the Western civilization needs more people like him if it wants to continue to be the leading civilization in the world both on the technological front as well as on the population front -his ideas on low birthrates being the biggest threat to civilization are right on the money.To summarize, I cannot recommend this book highly enough.I want thank both Elon Musk as well as Walter Isaacson for partnering to make it a reality. It's very rare in human history to have a chance to get such a detailed insight into the mind of one of the contemporary history making personalities.",book
"Every aerospace executive and board member should read Walter Isaacsonâs biography of Elon Musk. Starting from scratch Musk has built Americaâs leading rocket and space communications company by ignoring the hidebound bureaucratic rules of the major aerospace companies delivering rockets at one tenth the cost of his bloated competitors. Muskâs rules are:1. Doubt every requirement.2. Question every cost?3. Act with a sense of urgency.4. Learn by failing.5. Improvise.The other secret that Musk applied to Tesla as well as SpaceX is that he integrated design, engineering, and manufacturing so that each of those entities can learn from the others. Thus, engineers and designers are able to make improvements in manufacturing as issues arise. Steve Jobs at Apple integrated design and engineering, but outsourced manufacturing to China.Rising from an unhappy childhood in South Africa, Musk became a Silicon Valley entrepreneur to become part of the famed âPayPal Mafia.â He used his PayPal success to fund Tesla and SpaceX and the rest is history.Muskâs genius has the ability to inspire loyalty, at least for a time, of a host brilliant people who built his empire. However, empathy is not his middle name, and, in many ways, he seems to be a very cruel person. He is one of those people who professes to love humanity, but really doesnât like people as individuals.Isaacson discusses Muskâs chaotic personal life. Three marriages, 11 children two of whom by sperm donation. Isaacson doesnât explain why so many of Muskâs children were conceived by in vitro fertilization.Then, of course there is Twitter, now called X after his favorite letter. His adventure at Twitter seems to be one giant ego trip where he promised to free that social media site from it âwokeness.â To say the staff of Twitter was woke, would be an understatement. He wanted to encourage free expression, yet under his rule Twitter has become a cesspool of hate.I had my own run in with twitter. Despite all of Muskâs talk of a new openness I was banned for using the term âcircular firing squadâ to characterize Hunter Biden bringing his father into his legal thicket. Something is really wrong with X and from press accounts is seems to be getting worse by the day.Despite being hagiographic at times, Isaacson brings to life one of our leading entrepreneurs who is bringing us into new electric and space ages.",book
"This book is very likely Isaacson's best. One, he got almost unlimited access to Elon and team for two years. Two, Elon! Three, a fascinating case of embracing Risk-with-capital-R as not something to avoid (""do no harm""), not something to optimize (risk-reward analysis) but something to warmly embrace and overcome with will, ""surge"" and first-principle driven engineering.The book has essentially three broad parallel themes often intertwined in narratives -Relationship -- Family and friends - relationship and evolution of it with Elon's parents, grandparents of both sides, kids, spouses/SOs, siblings - especially Kimbal, cousins and a handful of business friends including some employees in both Tesla and SpaceX.Results -- Zip2/Paypal, EVs, SolarRoof, Rockets/NASA, Neuralink, Hyperloop, Twitter - workspaces where Elon ventured and revolutionized them.Regulating Principles - This is where Isaacson has done a masterful job. He observed, probed and eked out a set of rules that Elon follows - with himself, with how he gets work done, with other people.As someone who's worked (""hardcore""ly, if I may) in Tesla during famed ""Production Hell"" and was lucky to witness several of the events mentioned - e.g., 5000th car of the week, a black Model 3, coming out of factory on June 30, 2018 at 2 AM-ish - Isaacson's description of Tesla, and its mission-driven culture, is accurate, though as a genuine believer in that mission, seemed awfully short. Some of Elon's brilliant ""management emails"" deserved a mention - e.g., how not/to communicate (no abbreviations; hierarchy agnostic), how to/not meet (get out if you are adding no value), how to set goals (Hofstadder's law - set it so ambitious that even missing it by 50% would still get it done twice as fast had it not been set so) etc. Plus, Elon is always highly readable, and short.To bridge to standard practices of management, as it is followed in most western world today, the author follows up with most people after they had ""interesting pushbacks"" from Elon, mostly when they either did not have an answer and did not say they did not know, or when - simply - Elon was thinking far ahead of them, and thinking multi-threaded to not offer much of ""contextual relevance"". The emphasis on ""small teams with right individuals will always outcompete large teams"" is spot on and is essentially why Autopilot is successful with 150 engineers and Twitter was awfully slow moving with few thousands.Last third of the book was often observed and written in first person. The author was present in many of those events. But that takes a little bit away from the velocity of the book and perhaps adds 50-60 more pages that merely repeat the themes already established, with apt narratives, earlier in the book. Moving Twitter's 5000 servers from Sacramento data center to Portland - first thought to take months till Elon diverted his jet, landed in Sacramento, opened an air vent with a (borrowed) utility knife, went underneath the rack and essentially did a ""POC"" - is one such example. It was an intersting read, especially for an engineer, irrespective.No single individual in last 100 years, perhaps, did change things more for ""humanity as a macro"". ""Elon Musk"" is the best way to understand him and is a brilliant, captivating read. The grand theme of the book, to me, was as Elon was quoted - ""This is how civilizations decline. They quit taking risks. And when they quit taking risks, their arteries harden. Every year there are more referees and fewer doers.""This is not just a book on Elon Musk. This is a book to look at risk with a fundamentally different world-, or should I say 'cosmic-', view.",book
"Walter Isaacsonâs narrative on Elon Musk is nothing short of a masterful voyage through the labyrinth of one of the most iconic innovators of our age. The book is a meticulously crafted narrative, weaving the intricacies of Muskâs remarkable journey with a depth that leaves the reader both inspired and enlightened. Itâs a comprehensive expedition into the life and mind of Elon Musk (EM), displaying an exquisite balance of awe-inspiring moments coupled with a grounded critique that keeps the narrative tethered to a realm of practicality.The section that notably stands out is the exploration into EMâs management mantras. The unraveling of 'The Algorithm,' a term synonymous with Muskâs methodical approach towards problem-solving, and the traits he values in his team - Excellence, Trust, and Discipline, are not merely discussed but dissected. This portion of the book is a well of insights for anyone eager to decode the enigmatic leadership style of EM.Isaacson, with his seasoned narrative prowess, doesnât merely tell a story; he takes you on an intellectual expedition, unveiling layers of EMâs persona and managerial acumen. The critique embedded within the narrative ensures the reader doesnât get lost in the glorification but stays grounded, appreciating the practical implications and the tangible takeaways from Muskâs journey.A unique charm of Isaacsonâs writing is his ability to delve deep into the subject while maintaining a broader perspective. The wish for his next venture to contrast the geniuses heâs chronicled is palpable. One can only anticipate the richness such a narrative would entail, juxtaposing the different shades of brilliance that have shaped the modern technological epoch.In conclusion, this book isnât just a biography; itâs a meticulously crafted lens through which one can appreciate the genius of Elon Musk, rendered with a level of finesse and understanding that is quintessentially Isaacson. Itâs not just a read, but an experience, that leaves you with a profound understanding and a lingering curiosity for the boundless realm of innovation.",book
"This is a fascinating biography that tells the warts and all story of one of the greatest men of the 21st Century. Elon Musk has emerged from a toxic and abusive childhood to becoming the richest man on the planet, having revolutionized space travel and reinvented the electric car. The book tells in detail about how he did those things, as well as delving into robotics, AI, neural implants to cure blindness and paralysis, and other things.The book also notes that Musk is far from a nice guy, lacking the ability to feel empathy and having a tendency to fly into rages as well as deep depression. The book does not exactly put its subject on the couch, but it does give an insight into what drives him.Musk personifies the Great Man Theory of History. The theory suggests that history is driven by great men (almost always men) who rise to power seemingly out of nowhere and drive people and nations to achieve great things. Just Imagine what our world would be like without Musk and one must conclude that, for all of his quirks and flaws, the world is lucky to have him in it.",book
"This is a brilliant attempt by Walter Isaacson to delve into what makes up this century's genius Elon Musk. Not an easy book about a one of a kind human being. Elon Musk has gone and will go where no one else has, so far. He is a contradiction on virtually every level ... difficult to like but impossible not to respect hence the top people in technology eagerly work for and with him. He says what he believes and cares not at all for the repercussions because it is his truth. His predictions for the future of the earth and mankind are impossible to ignore and the liars despise him for it.For his part, Isaacson has captured this controversial genius as succinctly as he did Steve Jobs. I finished this book as an Elon Musk fan and think others will also.Read this book to learn about America's possibilities going forward not to learn how to be a billionaire.",book
"I don't think there is much doubt about Elon Musk being a genius - and genius' rarely fit well in the world the rest of us inhabit. Their thinking and drives simply don't work in a system based on getting along and establishing your place. A genius is constantly a square peg in a round hole - that is almost the definition of the term.However, we all want a look inside the mind of a genius. Walter Isaacson is the rare writer who can present a complex person in such a way that we want to read each and every word. By the end of the book we are both excited about what Musk can do and totally exhausted by the effort he requires of those around him.I venture to say none of us will agree with everything he does/says and we shouldn't worry about that. He will try anything and is willing to fail spectacularly. It is the only way he sees to get big things done. While I certainly agree with him about this, I wouldn't want to trade places. Walter Isaacson is able to get the reader to see all this.",book
"The book is a very long and detailed book but the most fascinating book I have ever read. I had a negative impression of Elon Musk and was curious why he was always in the news. I thought he got lucky with his successes. But he is nothing like I imagined. He is a completely unique, brilliant, compulsive and driven human being. He is a slave driver with his employees but he is right there working with them. Everything he accomplished which is beyond anything I knew about is incredible. There is so much about this world I know nothing about and at 78 will never know. Walter Isaacson did an excellent job with this book.",book
"If you follow Muskâs companies like Tesla & SpaceX, you will probably find this biography of the man behind them to be very illuminating. Muskâs companies are an extension of Musk himself and his ideals. The book explains a lot and I recommend it.It was a sometimes uncomfortable read for me because I have known extremely intelligent people with similar personality traits to Musk due to my schooling and career. I donât enjoy dealing with them.The author is to be commended for his reasonably balanced handling of any political issues that arise.Of course, the Musk life saga continues. After reading this book, you may, like me, ponder what is going to happen to Muskâs companies as he approaches his expiration date.",book
"The author did an amazing job or capturing the ins and outs of one of, if not, the greatest innovators of our time. It is amazing to see what one can do when they have the backing of billions of dollars. I am not taking anything away from the pure genius of Elon Musk. Just commenting on something that is not addressed in the book, which is that he created instant adulthood financial success, and was as genius about reinvesting it in humanity focused endeavors as he is genius about building and scaling technology. I loved every minute of this book and found myself becoming more inspired each day.",book
"Basic recipes with good directions and photos. I'd have loved to have had this helpful info when I was young and trying to learn to cook by myself. It was always a joy to surprise my mom with food on the table when she got home from work, even when just a grilled cheese sandwich (made in an old pie pan under the broiler) and a can of soup I'd opened and heated on the stove! The possibilities available in this book are a great beginning to open the imaginations of curious kids to tastes, textures, and the many rewards and confidence boost of good cooking!My only negative comment is the use of food processors and similar newer tools when a large bowl, a spoon or spatula, and some elbow grease worked fine as 'food processors' for centuries...insert eye roll here! Also, describing to the kids how to to separate an egg USING YOUR BARE HANDS was a completely new and approaching barbaric idea I had never heard of or even thought of doing, ick! When there are always two halves of eggshells to use from one to the other, why would anyone pour the raw egg in their hand to let all but the yolk then dribble through their fingers?? Aside from the convenient shells already in your hands, there's also an easy kitchen tool called an egg separater, yes really, that could have been shown among the kitchen tools. Much easier, less gross, and all around cleaner. Otherwise, this book and the baking book for kids are mostly recommended, except they both provide these same glaringly bogus instructions for unsuspecting children. Hmmm, maybe that was the point?? ð¤",book
"My teen grandsons said they were getting bored with making the same food all the time. They are 15 yrs old and over six feet tall and eating ALL the time! I wanted a guide for them with tempting photos, lots of helps and charts (this book is loaded, front and back!), nutritious recipes, and a lay-flat book. It's not just for KIDS -I love this book too!TEN STARS!!",book
"I love that this book covers many fundamental of cooking, let's thing chefs understand terminology nuanced measuring methods and helps introduce kids to organized way of cooking. The graphics and very appropriate while the layout is very typical of a regular cook book. I also love that whole we can find any recipe we want online this is a lovely little go to for building confidence for even beginner adult cooks. The title addressed to ""young chefs"" can also be interpreted as an adult who is new to cooking! :)",book
So I bought this a while ago for my son who loves to cook. It got put on his book shelves and semi lost for awhile. He discovered it recently and has been so excited about the recipes. Iâm no chef but learned to cook at a young age. So throwing something together is second nature for me. However as a parent my son doesnât always like the way I teach things so this book is a great guide for him and allows us to cook things he might not have tried otherwise. Easy to follow. Mostly simple recipes nothing too hard or advanced and great variety. If your kid loves helping in the kitchen this is another awesome way to help them choose healthy food for the most part that they cook with your help.,book
"Once you get past the visual effect of all those words and pictures crammed together, it reveals some nice if mostly predictable recipes but also some unexpected and helpful tips. Though it's written as if for a child (""get an adult's help""), I think preteen children might be rather daunted by the book's layout. With adult help, though, it could be helpful to preteens and teens alike.",book
"I purchased this book along with a kids cooking set to gift my 9 year ojd grandson for his birthday.He immediately flipped through and noticed the book shows him how to properly cut and hold what heâs cutting. He said, âoh now I see why the professional chefs hold their veggies that wayâI canât wait to have him in my kitchen sharing whatâs he learned.Thank you!",book
"I bought this cookbook for my 10 yr old grandson and he followed his 1st recipe by himself, no help from anyone. His family said the recipe was delicious. Iâm so impressed with this book I want one for myself! It has lots of useful info, tells you what tools to use, and how to prepare ingredients for each recipe. I highly recommend this cookbook for the budding young chef in your family!",book

"So cute. We loved ""Llama Llama Red Pajamas"" and these cute holiday quick reads are fun to get into the holiday spirit in a 10 minute read. Ok, I have a toddler, we stretch it out, but let's not get caught up in how long it takes to read it. There are fun images, pretty colors, and I love that you can ""see"" the canvas texture of the illustrations. My daughter is 16 months and I am sure she will grow out of this, but she loves books now and her attention span isn't great so I really think these short poem stories are just perfect for her.",book
I really like the Llama books we have but this was a disappointment and did not earn a place in our bookcase. The main reason is it does not mention to whom thanks was given nor the reason for the holiday. If it wasn't suggested to be a Thanksgiving book it wouldn't be an issue but....as such I returned it.,book
"This book is for younger children (under 3). It is good for toddlers as it is a board book and has short, rhyming phrases on each page, though I would not recommend this for a preschooler and above. I believe this is the llama llama series for younger children and I bought it by mistake thinking that it would have more pages (as noted on the Amazon webpage for this book: 14), though was disappointed when I received it. My child was excited to receive it, but it is such a quick read that I would not recommend it for 3 and over, but feel that it is good for children under 3.",book
"""Llama Llama Gives Thanks"" is a great addition to the Llama Llama board books collection. It is an easy story to read aloud which is one of the things I love about the Llama Llama board books. It is also a short enough story that my twin 20 month olds don't get board and sit through the whole story. In fact, they like it so much we can read it multiple times in one sitting. I would highly recommend this book to anyone who is a fan of the other Llama Llama board books.",book
Good book for a young toddler - especially if you pull out the lessons and repeat them in other settings.,book
"Appreciating the little things in life, the joy of day-to-day existence, and the love for your family and your work is what Tom Lake meant to me. Tom Lake refers to a (fictional) summer stock theater in northern Michigan in the 1980s, close to the locale of the current 2020 timeline--- a cherry farm (and pears, and apples). The late eighties marked a luminous period for protagonist/narrator Lara, a time that she walked the fine line between adulting and adulthood, coming of age amid a torrent of drama that swept her up in its fury. And then there was Our Town, the play within the novel that portrayed Laraâs life on the stage (and backstage).Lara is telling her three twenty-something daughters about her short stint as an actress in her twenties, and the brief romantic affair with Peter Duke, a famous movie star before he was a famous movie star. The gorgeous cherry farm backdrop is like a staid but vivid character, with Lara, husband Joe, and the three girls all together for the first time in a while. Due to the pandemic, they donât have the usual crew to help pick the fruit, so the storytelling unfolds as the family works the orchard during harvest time. Like the cherries, some parts are sweet, some tart, and all of it is juicy.I felt the air, inhaled the scents, the cherries, the land and the whole layout of the farm while reading. And there is the kindness, too, of this family, whose flaws are also part of their strengths. The chaos of Laraâs life as a young woman is juxtaposed with the serenity of her life now, and the two timelines fluidly alternate, sometimes gently, at other times with piercing intensity. And every storyline has at least two. So, when you read about Lara in the past, or present, you just canât help sniffing around to see the connections, of what surprise is crouched in the corner or hidden behind the door. I verily slipped into Laraâs character and imagined what decisions I would make as her, given so many pressing options and dilemmas.Ann Patchett nails it every time, her characters are complex and her graceful pace is measured even when events are brutal. Lara is a radiant work-in-progress during her young years, many readers will see themselves in her. I was a local stage actor in Austin during my twenties, so I immersed myself in Tom Lake, pretending to be Lara acting as Emily Gibbs and then back to Lara again. The two timelines showed the difference between the fiery summer love of youth and the deep, tender, and mature love of family that you helped to create. The high points were explosive, even when they were pin-drop quiet. Laraâs low points stirred me almost to tears; I could feel her pulse against mine.If youâve never seen a production or havenât read Our Town, youâre about to get a spoilerâs worth in the novel. But I think Ms. Patchett has surmised that most of her readers are already familiar with Thornton Wilderâs play. She coalesced Our Town and Tom Lake together in a way that reveals her refined skill of integration. Tom Lake and Our Town were separate but conjoined. I know that doesnât make sense, but it will when you read the book. She also quotes Chekhov at pique (and even peak) intervals; she shares the Russian writerâs work with spare but specific devotion.I recently learned that Patchett has never owned a smart phone, and doesnât herself do social media (she talks to the camera and her staff completes the rest). She has never used Google, or researched on Wikiâshe does it the old-fashioned way. And perhaps sheâs that slightly eccentric but lovely gentlewoman you see carrying paper road maps!Tom Lake is thoughtful, deft, and life-affirming. (It isnât a pandemic novel, even though it takes place during that time). Thereâs comedy, tragedy, dramaâa look-back-at-your- own-life kind of book. Itâs classic Ann Patchett.Thereâs this passage that really tickled me from the book. Itâs toward the end but not a spoiler, itâs thematic with the rest of the narrative. Lara was so busy recounting the past for her daughters that she forgot to make lunch, which she said she should have been working on while talking. âThe past need not be so all-encompassing that it renders us incapable of making egg salad.â Priorities!",book
"I certainly loved Bel Canto, and, as a result, I was eager to read Tom Lake (based on the glowing reviews). However, after 10 pages, then 25 pages, then 50, I was willing to close it and put in the little library box or pass it on to a neighbor. It just seemed so done before. The story was obvious and the characters were all meh. Everything seemed like it had been hashed over a million times a million times better.But, I kept reading because the neighbor I would have given it to had left for vacation. I figured I'd plod through (actually, if I weren't so willing to close it and pick up another book, it would have been a quick read) until the neighbor came home. So, of course, I read on. Mid way through, I was invested but still willing to close it and move on. Three quarters through, the characters became more human and interesting, and then I realized that the author wasn't reinventing the wheel but reinterpreting ""Our Town."" (Duh, she said, after being hit over the head with the sledge hammer of metaphor of the plot.) And, on the last page, I was crying.So, I do recommend this book.",book
"Ann Patchett is one of my favorite writers and she has once again written a novel I love.The novel takes place at the beginning of the Covid epidemic. Lara, her husband, and her three young adult daughters are residing on the family orchard in Northern Michigan. The narrative is told from Lara's viewpoint and consists primarily of her daughters' wanting to know about her past life - especially her romantic involvement with the now famous actor, Peter Duke.Much of the story is about a summer stock stage production of 'Our Town' located in Michigan on Tom Lake. Lara is in her twenties and has been called upon to take the lead role after the original actress has decided to quit. On Lara's first day, she is greeted by a charismatic young man named Peter Duke. From their first meeting evolves a drawn-out romance and affair that leaves Lara much beholden to Peter's narcissistic view of himself. Lara is quite aware that her daughters want to know all the intimacies that she and Peter shared, but she is not ready to give out these details freely.It is understood that Lara once had a promising future in acting but she chose to give it up for what she considers her idyllic life as a mother and wife. Her daughters find this all hard to absorb and want to know every last bit about Laura's time with Peter and her involvement with the stage.The writing flows beautifully and the imagery is incandescent. I could see Lara and feel her emotions. Ann Patchett knows people and her empathic writing exudes from every page. There isn't one false note.I have never read Our Town but that didn't stop me from loving this novel, nor did it prevent me from understanding what was transpiring. I learned a lot about stage production, acting, and actors.I especially loved how the author provided each of her daughters with a distinct and inimitable personality, all beloved to her and each other. This is a book to savor and reflect on. It is as sweet as the smell of cherries in Lara's Michigan orchard.",book
"Ann Patchett is a gifted writer and once again her unique ability to create characters within an engaging plot is well developed. The story revolves around Tom Lake, a community summer theatre production in Michigan. Patchett weaves a story told from the main character who aspires to be an actress but is conflicted with the reality of the demands within the acting profession. A side story includes the quaint setting of a cherry fruit farm and Patchett describes the scenery of the farm and daily life with flawless description. The novel is connected to the famous play, Our Town. Since I had not read the play for many, many years I was a little lost in the beginning. Rereading Our Town in advance might bring familiarity to the reader. I recommend the story; one of early romance, missed opportunities and chosen paths.",book
"This book grew on me. It started out slow and I wasnât so engaged with the characters at first but I found myself checking in on them often and by the end of the book I loved them all. What initially had me not excited about the book became one of its highlights. Itâs about real people who are all familiar and very human. Life and how things happen, and relationships and experiences and how they define us. So very relatable. And now I too want to live on a cherry orchard in Michigan (or at least visit one!).",book
"I love all of Ann Patchettâs books. They are all different and all interesting. I listened to this one (narrated by Meryl Streep!) AND read it on the Kindle app (trying to finish it before a book club meeting), and I loved hearing Streep read Patchettâs lovely words. Is it my favorite of her books? No, but itâs still worth reading!",book
"I love Ann Patchett, whose gifts as a storyteller are almost unmatched, as wide-ranging as her varying choice of subjects. TOM LAKE is another triumph- and not just because it centers around folks in the theatre. Although I'm sure that helped.Lara Kenison played Emily Webb in her high school production of OUR TOWN, as have so many young girls have in their past. But for Lara, it becomes a touchstone in her life. In college, she reprises the role, and a famous Hollywood agent happens to see her performance. The Tinseltown legend suddenly becomes real - flying to LA, screen tests, her first film role, commercials, even a TV series. Then, while waiting for the film's long-delayed release, she goes off to summer stock at Tom Lake in Wisconsin. There, she meets her first great love, a fire of ambition named Peter Duke.Years later, Lara unspools the story of her Hollywood adventure to her now-grown daughters, including some discrete details of her love affair with Duke, now a huge movie star. Lara and her husband Joe run a fruit farm in rural Michigan. The story of how she goes from the LA Dream Factory to the cherry orchard unfolds while she and her daughters pick the ripening fruit in the hot summer sun.There are twists and turns in every story, and Lara's journey from ingenue to farm wife has some hairpin turns that the reader will likely never see coming. It's Patchett's great skill as a story master that keeps us as engaged as her daughters, hearing the tale unspool. While the three sisters (yes, in a cherry orchard) demand to know more, we are as eager as they to learn Lara's tale of adventures on stage and off.I tore through this book in a few days, despite a busy end-of-summer schedule. (Thank heavens for a day off to finish it!) It immediately ranks with my favorite of Patchett's works.A great read.",book

"Phew. I made it. Finished. Complete. Fin.At 776 pages, The Covenant of Water is a commitment. It's long, it's dense, it's heartbreaking more often than it's not, and with every new character introduced, I found myself wondering where it was going and how it might end. But it's also beautifully rendered, meticulously researched, and a tour de force. Given that, I have no idea how I should rate it against everything else I've read this year.The novel spans almost 80 years and takes place primarily in southern India. The story opens in 1900 with the arranged wedding of a 12-year-old girl to a much older man. Following their strained and awkward nuptials, he brings her to his home called Parambil, around which a community has developed. As she begins to learn how to be a wife to her husband, and the awkwardness between them begins to thaw as she grows older, she also comes to learn of her husband's genealogy, and the repeated tragedy that afflicted many of his ancestors. The girl -- who by now has become a young woman and is known as ""Big Ammachi"" -- comes to refer to it as The Condition, whereby an unnatural number of ancestors in her husband's lineage have had an aversion to water and several have died in what would typically be avoidable circumstances involving water.While The Condition crops up as a through line over the course the novel, the book is less about that mysterious affliction than it is a multi-generational character study of a family and the people who move in their circles. The novel flows like a river, with detailed scenes and character development intertwining. The reader, meanwhile, is left to be carried along like an oarless boat upon that river. I will admit that I got frustrated at times with the book. Even by the halfway point, it felt like plenty of story had been told and it was time to wrap things up, yet nearly 400 additional pages still awaited me. What more needs to be told? How will this end? When will it end?There is a passage in the book in which Verghese writes the following:""And now (she) is here, standing in the water that connects them all in time and space and always has. The water she first stepped in minutes ago is long gone and yet it is here, past and present and future inexorably coupled, like time made incarnate. This is the covenant of water: that they're all linked by their acts of commission and omission, and no one stands alone.""Shame on me for doubting Verghese or his intentions, and for presuming these seemingly disconnected pieces wouldn't eventually find one another to complete the puzzle. While I was being carried along the river, Verghese was weaving a complex tapestry around me. Every character and story in the meandering novel has a purpose, and all of that intention is pulled together and made clear In the final 150 (or so) pages. Verghese honors the passage above, and like the water he references, he beautifully ties together the strands of his story.It's been more than a decade since I read Cutting For Stone, and I remember it fondly although the details are admittedly hazy. Acknowledging the hazy memory could be off a bit, I still feel that The Covenant of Water represents Verghese taking his skills to another level. There is plenty of medicine in the book, like in Cutting For Stone, but more broadly than in that work, with Verghese tackling several diseases that have since been mostly eradicated (with leprosy leading the way). Verghese also uses almost 80 years of Indian history and the birth of the nation as a backdrop, starting with the British occupation and class (and caste) systems that evolved around that, through Indian independence and the battle between socialism and a more market-driven economy that followed. The role of women in Indian society is a consistently and critically examined theme. As such, in many ways The Covenant of Water is an ode to the strength and contributions of women, particularly in a more male-dominated society and culture.So how do I rate this beast of a work, which was undeniably brilliant and complex but also struggled to retain my interest at times? For starters, it is the book for which I have the most respect among those I've read this year. I didn't enjoy it the most, and I wouldn't universally recommend it (as I said at the top, it's a commitment). But when I consider the amount of time, and research, and intricate plotting, and effort that went into this, and then compare that to some of the more enjoyable (but less expansive) books among this year's favorites, I have to acknowledge the author's accomplishment. While I didn't love every moment reading the book, and I found myself breaking it up and reading other things in between, I did really enjoy it if I look back on it in its entirety. If it had fizzled to a conclusion, that wouldn't be the case, but I think the final two sections of the book pull everything together in a wonderful way that made me appreciate the purposeful intention of all that came before.For those of us that read regularly, I'm sure we've all thought to ourselves at some point, ""I bet I could write a pretty good novel."" I have certainly read books, good books, and come away still believing (or even being inspired) that I might be able to create something comparable. The Covenant of Water is in a different league, and for anyone harboring aspirations of authorship, it will humble you and remind you that there are many levels to writing, and there are certain levels that are simply unobtainable for all but a few. It's the type of book that illustrates an author operating at the apex of his craft, where all of his skills around writing, planning, dialogue, structure, and research come together to create something beautiful. Go in with eyes wide open -- this will probably dominate your nightstand for several weeks -- but trust that the payoff at the end is worth the journey to get there.",book
"This is a monumental and original family saga that is like nothing I have ever read. It is richly imaginative and packs an emotional wallop.Taking place in Kerala, a state in South India on the Malabar Coast, it spans nearly 80 years and is brutally realistic. This isn't a sweetsie-lovey story. It's about life. Real life. And it hurts the reader sometimes! Children die, loved ones die by suicide, people are killed in somewhat brutal and violent ways, and several suffer debilitating injuries. It's a tough read because I was emotionally connected with the characters and then wham! They die or suffer. But that is the ultimate premise of this book: Finding the meaning in suffering.Magnificently written by physician and bestselling author Abraham Verghese, this epic multigenerational novel begins in 1900 and ends in 1977, centering on the character of Big Ammachi. She is 12 years old when her father dies, leaving her mother destitute. In a desperate move, this little girl is hurriedly married off to a 40-year-old widower and father of a 2-year-old boy, who lives Kerala, a long day's journey away. She is nicknamed Big Ammachi (Big Mother) by Jojo, the little boy, and the name sticks as she grows up to become the matriarch of a large family living on the 500-acre estate of Parambil. As she soon discovers, this family has a curse, ""the Condition,"" as they call it, that takes the life of someone every generation.In addition, there are parallel stories that at first are seemingly unrelated. The most intriguing one is that of Digby Kilgour, a surgeon from Glasgow, Scotland, who joins the Indian Medical Service in Madras. His is also a story of joy and tragedy that eventuallyâsurprisingly and explosivelyâconnects with the family in Parambil, although it is a long and circuitous journey to that end.In addition to a compelling, ever-evolving, and multilayered plot inhabited by bold and vivid characters, this is a profound work of literature that speaks eloquently and poignantly about one family's place on Earthâhow they love, how they argue, how they do good, how they do evil, how they worship God, and how they make the world a better place by just inhabiting it. As you can probably tell from the title, the imagery and symbolism of water and specifically how the covenant of water links all human beings is brilliant.This is also a love letter to medicineâto dedicated physicians, to the scientists who make the medical discoveries, to the hardworking nurses, and especially to all those who give their life to care for the sick.Bonus: Even though it's told only in words, you'll get a tour of South India that is so vibrant and so realistic that when I Googled photos of the area, it appeared very much like it did in my imagination. The land is so much a part of the novel that it is almost a character of its own. This is truly a magical place with beautiful beaches, elaborate canals, and picturesque mountains filled with monkeys, elephants, snakes, birds, and tigers.Two pieces of advice to make reading this 700+ page book easier:â¢ There are dozens of characters in this novel, and even the Kindle X-ray feature is not that helpful. Go to the author's website and download the character list. Print it if you're reading the paper version of the book. If you're reading it on Kindle, I advise you to use the ""send to Kindle"" feature. I had this document right next to the book, so it was easy to search for or find the character. It doesn't take long before you'll know who everyone is.â¢ There are quite a few words in the novel in Malayalam, the official language of Kerala. In most cases, it's easy to figure out the meaning based on the context of the sentence, but I kept my phone nearby so I could Google words I couldn't decipher.",book
"I never write book reviews. Until now. My house is a wreck. Let me explain: I just read two Abraham Verghese books back to back in a week. If you know that author, you understand why Iâve accomplished little else.I just finished his latest, his magnum opus, The Covenant of Water. I had a love-hate relationship with this grand novel. The 765 pages required a big commitment but since I am a voracious reader, that wasnât a problem. The love part was because of Vergheseâs outstanding writing. His characters and settings practically jump off the pages. And thanks to the authors everyday occupation as a physician, I now know more about anatomy than I need or want to know! The writing evokes a curiosity that leads to Googling maps of India and researching Indian dissident groups and even looking up the bones of the body. At one point I was ready to book a flight to India. This was getting dangerous.The hate part relates to the same thing: you fall in love with one character and the author moves on to another seemingly unrelated one. Wait, you cry. Donât stop there! Well, be patient dear reader. All is not lost or even what it seems.The story is one of things lost and found, of overcoming suffering and moving on with life - themes most of us can relate to in some way. The shifts in time and place and characters caused some confusion, especially when I was listening to the audiobook. This is a book you need to read - I mean really read and pay attention. It is not an easy read: more than once I found myself wondering what the heck that has to do with where this is going. But, true to form, Verghese wraps it up neatly in the last 100 pages. He does go around Robin Hoodâs barn to get there, but in the end it is a very satisfying conclusion: one that earns it â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸ on my book list and one of my top five for the year. His previous novel, Cutting for Stone, tops my list for the year. This one was close for that honor. And it was worth the journey.",book
"This is a powerful epic novel, exquisitely written and the characters are engaging, at times mysterious, and unforgettable. The author weaves seemingly disparate plot lines that keep the reader wondering about how these story lines could possibly come together. It all comes together in the end, beautifully and hauntingly.I've seen some reviews proclaiming this to be a faith-based story, which it certainly is not. That impression may have arisen in that one of the central characters is spiritual, and happens to be a follower of Christianity in a non-Western society. I've seen some reviews claiming it is boring, which I find inexplicable, but realize it may be a challenging read and not for everyone. Bottom line is this is a complex, thought-provoking masterpiece, and unforgettable. I highly recommend it!",book
"Abraham Verghese is the Michelangelo of writers. I was caught up from the beginning and captivated by the entire story. What made the difference for me was also listening to him read (no, perform!) the book. His accent, word pronunciations and expression were so much better than the voice in my head. I usually prefer to read, rather than listen, but once I heard him perform, I couldnât go back. I even followed along in the book so I could see the words he was reading. This is the best book Iâve ever read/listened to and there are not enough superlatives to properly honor it.",book
"I was initially struck by the author's ability to describe miserable situations and unappealing human traits with such neutrality, no judgment or apologies. And then I was pulled fully into this book, this story, this epic and stopped ""judging"" it myself. Instead I fell into the beautiful, rich, tragic world Verghese creates. The backdrop of the Indian countryside and the swirling political climate were backburner issues that almost became their own characters as they enriched and contextualized the saga.I LOVED this book and was sad for it to end. Halfway through it I bought another of his books",book
"This is a very long book, and it took me a long time to read it. Sometimes I left it aside for days, because it had not grabbed me. The two stories seemed disjointed and didn't make much sense in the same book. However, I continued because it was so beautifully written. At the astonishing end everything comes together and becomes clear.I am incredibly impressed by the author's wealth of knowledge and how well he shares it through his writing. His list of quotes is incredible. I learned very much and this book will always remain in my memory.",book
"This was a great generational saga that I wished to have another 700 pages to read! It is hard to review such an astounding work of art. As you get into the story, a 12 year old bride embarks on her journey to her new, much older husband. In the husband's family, there is some sort of mysterious curse that causes someone from each generation to die by water.As the story develops, you will become totally immersed in the people and their cultures and customs, their histories and politics. I was thoroughly engrossed and kept reading until my kindle ran out of gas! For a better synopsis, find The New Yorker magazine's book recommendations. I also recommend reading ""Cutting For Stone"" by this same author.",book
"Loved the book. Despite the numerous tragedies that befell the characters, there were moments of great humor and profound joy. The story was so compelling, it was hard not to ignore work and other obligations to just read straight through.Occasionally the medical details feel a little excessive, but since many tie into the story, on balance they do add color.Hope to visit Kerala one day soon.",book
"The intersection between members of several families, especially in this rigid, rule-bound society, is fascinating to see, even as it evolves and changes. The impact of the Covenant of Water on many of the characters in the novel helps to hold together this sprawling story. I admit that I lost track of the names and relationships I of some of the characters, but by the end, I had sorted out who was who.",book
"I have been waiting years for Stephanie Plum to be shown as more than a bumbling, clueless thirty something. Finally, when I thought this would be my last book, I got my wish! I started to read and figured it would be the same ole, same ole with Stephanie taking a soft approach to her job, having her cars blown up, settling for whatever the men in her life dished out and basically getting by on luck, but this time she finally showed that she could be good at this job and maybe not just settle for what life was throwing at her. She put her intelligence to use, got tough and pulled through on her skips. She was, for once, great. And just when I thought my dream Stephanie book was finally happening, the author pulls that ending. I call foul! But I have to admit it was the best Plum book she had done in years. However, it is time to end this back and forth about Morelli and Ranger. It is not fair to the faithful readers who have been punked book after book making us believe Stephanie will finally get her man. Though, I am still âTeam Rangerâ in case anyone cares.",book
"I have read every book in this series and loved each one. Dirty Thirty Didn't disappoint. So many times I laughed. As a Jersey Girl living in the suburbs of Trenton, there's so much I can relate to. Lula is hysterically funny and I'm in love with Morelli's dog, Bob. I can't wait to see what the author has planned for the next book in this series, because she left us hanging! I kinda think I know, but then again, the unpredictable can happen! Thank you for an enjoyable read!",book
"If you like Ms. Plum, and all the crazy characters in this long running series, you won't be disappointed in her latest journey into mayhem. Stolen diamonds, a mythical creature stalking Lula, Morelli in Miami, Steph with who else -- Ranger! With all the lunacy, there's the thread to the whole murky mystery, and the last scene is jaw-dropping. Can't wait for #31! Oh, enjoyed the favorite hilarious quotes from all the other novels (an added bonus by the author) at the end of the book. Highly recommended. I'm still smiling!",book
"Janet Evanovich has created another triumphant masterpiece with this latest Stephanie Plum novel. This one is my favorite of the series featuring the characters of the ""Burg"" that make these books so much fun. And as Lula and Stephanie hunt for FTAs and get wrapped up in the insane world of NJ crime, you can't help but fall in love again and again with this series. The cliffhanger ending will drive me crazy until the next release but I'm sure will be worth the wait.",book
Having a great olâ time reading this book. I needed it for the giggles and cackles as I read it. I love the characters and I always love the people Stephanie has to chase. Itâs a wonderful escape for me to read about Stephanie and her cohorts. Bob the orange dog is a favorite. If you need a mood booster this is better than any pill. Believe me on this one. You wonât be sorry you spent time with Stephanie and her gang. I could go for Ranger!!!!,book
"First cliffhanger in the âPlumâ collection. Iâm not sure I want Stephanie to make a decision between men. I rather like the fine balance she manages to maintain and still deal with work and family. Iâm not sure Iâll ever tire of reading Stephanieâs adventures so, please, to paraphrase a phrase, â it ainât.broke so please, donât try to fix it.â Just as long as youâre inspired to write, I am ready to consume the next riveting installment.Love, from a âPlum Loverâ",book
"I have have thoroughly enjoyed this book! I am always left waiting for the next to be published to see what's happening with Stephanie. Even though you could read them out of order, it's been a pleasure to see how she has changed from when she first started working for Vinnie to now. Thank you, Janet Evanovich for letting us to along with you in this journey of your imagination. It's been a pleasure.",book
"Janet Evanovich is the best! Iâve read all of The Stephanie Plum books and they never fail to make me laugh out loud!Stephanie is a bounty hunter and with her sidekick Lula always get their person and then some. This one involves a murder, a theft and a missing body!And of course her never ending love of her hot cop boyfriend Morelli and the oh so hot Ranger!",book
"I thought this was the end of the Stephanie Plum story but it can't be, right? She has to make a choice and we have to find out what it is. Hopefully, there is an answer to this question and hopefully it is the right answer. I am sure not all the readers agree as to what that answer should be but it is obvious that big changes are happening in her life.",book
"It's no wonder Janet Evanovich is #1. Every single book is full of action, romance, fun and GREAT characters. She doesn't go over the top with MFC. I just love these books and sadly I have to wait for the next one. I am pro Ranger!!! Actually pro both but....Thank you for another great book!!!!",book

"If you ever had a Wattpad account, this is for you, my friend. A stalker who runs a secret organization to stop human trafficking and wants to lowkey overthrow the government? Who also happens to have mismatched eyes and scars? Sounds like every mafia mc love interest to me.However, this one actually hits. I devoured this book. It's intense, hot, very illegal and problematic, but I would be lying if I said I didn't enjoy (almost) every second of it. It was a guilty pleasure read (thank god no one else reads my book because the horror of picking that book up without any warning) and I'm so glad that it's fiction.It's great...until the last two chapters. I understand wanting a cliffhanger, but wtf? No villain reveal? What a load of bs. Also, this would be the root of my main issue with book two. There were no crumbs, no hints, nothing toward the villain's identity. I understand that there was a specific reason for this, wanting to keep the person overlooked, but you can't have a villain reveal/mystery without having enough clues to make the reader guess it. That's mystery 101. You have to reward the reader and the ending just laughs in the reader's face in that department.",book
"There's a reason I don't read incomplete duets or series because then I'm sad when I can't read the next book. I went against my better judgment with this book and I have no regrets (okay I have some because I hated waiting for book two) because I loved this story. The great news is the second book is out now, so you don't have to wait if you're reading this review!I've never read anything remotely similar to this book and I don't know that I ever will. This was my first time reading something truly as dark as this. I've read other books with heavy triggers, but this book was different. I read Satan's Affair beforehand (highly recommend reading that first) and I wasn't entirely sure what this book was going to be about. I knew a past murder, stalking, and love were involved, but that was it. If you had told me one of my top reads from 2021 would've been a stalker romance, I would've laughed in your face. Not only is the romance good, and the spice is off the charts hot, but the overarching story is just so good.Adeline is an author who moves into her grandmother's old home after she passes away. Adeline was close to her grandmother and felt a pull to come back to the home that always fascinated her. While living in the house, she discovers family secrets that have been buried for a long time, secrets involving her great grandmother. Her great grandmother was stalked, but here's the kicker? Her great grandmother had a spicy affair with her stalker! Adeline's great grandmother was murdered and she works with her best friend to figure out who did it. While trying to solve this mystery, Adeline finds herself in the same place as her great grandmother did with a hot stalker.Zade is a leader of a vigilante group that's only mission is to bring down trafficking rings and the horrible people that run them. And not just any type of trafficking rings. Rings that are linked to very powerful people in the country and the world. Zade is determined to get as many women and children to safety as he can. He puts himself in the line of fire to save the lives of the innocent people taken by these rings. He sounds like an ideal guy right? Well, did I mention he's also Adeline's stalker? Zade stumbles across Adeline by accident and it's a wrap for him. He wants to make her his and there's nothing that's going to stop him. Now I'm not saying he's still not an ideal guy (I do love him), but let's just say these are two VERY opposite qualities. On one hand, you have this man trying to save women and child, but on the other hand he's stalking a woman. Many would argue he can't be both a good and terrible guy at the same time, but I think this book begs to differ.I personally loved Adeline and thought she was a dynamic heroine. She was sassy, fun, and radiated fierceness. She does stand up for herself throughout the book, even to Zade, although standing up to him doesn't do much. I liked that we get her inner thoughts on Zade as their relationship plays out. I like watching her slowly open up to him and trust that he'll protect her, which seems like the opposite thing a stalker would do. One of my favorite things was when Adeline told her friend about one of her spicy encounters with Zade and that he ""took her soul"". I couldn't be more jealous of her, trust me. Based on the cliffhanger, book two isn't going to be an easy ride for Adeline, but I know she's going to be okay. Someone as fierce as her work her way through any situation, even if it takes some time.I cannot explain how much I love Zade. I know, I know, he's a stalker. Here's the thing: I just don't care. He really had me contemplating if getting stalked is that bad (it is, but let's ignore that). I loved how he was written to be so multilayered. H.D. Carlton knew what she was doing when she wrote him this way. He's meant to challenge everything you know and make you wonder if he's really all that bad. His qualities are so opposite of each other that he left me spinning so much throughout this book. I would take pauses while reading and say out loud, ""Am I actually into this man?"" or ""I'm in love with this unhinged man. Am I good?"" I laughed way too many times when doing this because I just know how people would react in my life if I told them how much I love Zade. The mouth on Zade is UNMATCHED. God, that man says the wildest stuff, but it's so unbelievably hot. And the things he does with his hands to Adeline? Where do I sign up??? I love his love for Adeline and I can't wait to see what he does in book two knowing how this book ended.The writing in this book is beautiful and so good. H.D. Carlton is talented and it shows in this book. I enjoyed the different storylines taking place and how they all connected to one another. I thought it was interesting to see Adeline live a similar life to her great grandmother. I think getting to read her great grandmother's thoughts on her own personal stalked helped Adeline in her own way. This book is just so so so good! I cannot recommend it enough. I do STRONGLY encourage everyone consider the triggers before reading. I look forward to book two!",book

I donât consider it a romance novel, but yes indeed, this is a dark romance. Emphasize on dark because nothing about this book is normally cute. Iâll explain myself.the story- Haunting Adeline is a book that dives deep down into the evil side of humanity, actually- it dives into the side where there is none. Despite its âdark romanceâ label, I have to unfortunately label it, reality. While there is romance in the book, it is not your peaches and cream type romance. More like blood and insanity. We follow along to see Adeline be stalked by Zade since the moment he laid eyes on her, he does everything in his power to make her his, even when she says no.the world building- is insanely accurate to real life, it IS real life. H.D. Carlton did a fantastic job at capturing the essence of what goes on in this messed up world. The accuracy scared me more than the story did, and thatâs a great thing to me!the trigger warnings- please read them, if youâre not someone like me who now looks at these lists like a shopping list, then please read the warnings.my thoughts- listen.. there are zero words I can gather to express how this book made me feel, other than I. LOVE. IT. I couldnât even tell you why. Maybe it has something to do with the characters? It could be the LEVEL OF INTENSITY Zadeâs obsession with Adeline is at? Maybe itâs that heâs quite literally a walking ironic, vigilante? Or is it that this book and the relationship to me screams âdeadly loveâ? At this point, Iâm convinced Iâm just as deranged as Adeline because while Haunting is dark- and Hunting Adeline is darker.. it had me giggling and kicking my feet like an excited 4 year old, the chokehold Zade has on me is probably unhealthy, but Iâm in the accepting stage so, letâs roll with it.conclusion- Iâm not going to sit here and lie or pretend.. by the end of this review, you may believe Iâm deranged, maybe even crazy. This story had me burning through the pages, I finished it in 12 hours to then pick up Hunting and finish that in under 5. I could not put it down. Yes, I read the trigger warnings. Yes, this is the first book I jumped into dark romance with. No, I donât regret it at all.. especially now because dark romance is my weakness. If this is the worst out there, and I just strolled through it like I was in a park, then I say bring it on to others.You will either hate this book with all your being, or absolutely love it so much, it hurts.. like me. There is NO in between.",book
"This is Not my genre whatsoever â¦ Iâm an Emily Henry Christina Lauren girlie with a side of Sarah J Maas, with Frieda McFadden and Jeneva Rose thrown in on occasion â¦ while I enjoy a thriller , they are usually not quite this dark. That being said â¦ I found this book entertaining, sooo spicy! Whoah! And all together intriguing",book
"Overall, I loved the book. I was craving something SPICY and I will say it gets ð¶ï¸ð¶ï¸ð¶ï¸ð¶ï¸ð¶ï¸/5 for Spice. Iâd say if you love the smut in books, this one wastes NO time! Probably 69% smut! I also rated it â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸/5 because I loved how chapters were told in the perspective of the main characters. I also appreciated how sometimes we would get a chapter from the Manipulatorâs perspective and then the next chapter would be The Shadowâs perspective of the previous chapter but then it would continue or give a little more information. It was thrilling to read and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND to anyone who likes smut, true crime investigations, and Law & Order SVU. JUST READ THE DAMN BOOK!â ï¸Spoilers below!!!!!!â ï¸Like seriously this is my summary soâ¦ expectMAJORSPOILERS:Adeline is an author who falls prey to a stalker. Not just an ordinary stalker, but a tech-saavy, rich, vigilante stalker who ironically saves women and children by day and stalks HER by night. Heâs no joke either, he told her not to let a guy at a club touch her, and so to spite him she brings him back to her house for a little woohoo action, well âThe Shadowâ doesnât like it and interrupts by banging on her door and then when boy wonder comes out, âthe shadowâ kidnaps him and kills him slowly, as a punishment to Addie for not listening to him he gifts her a box with boy wonders SEVERED HANDS. The sexual tension and fear slowly build each chapter after that. Hard to believe he did her a favor, but the guy she was hooking up with was actually a terrible guy. Any who, The Shadow - aka Zade- does a bunch of messed up things but then a bunch of hell yeah things so as the reader you end up rooting for him. OH!!! and also while all this is going on, Adeline is trying to solved her GREAT grandmothers murder which also involves a stalker but by the end we realize it was this guy Frank (a man who wanted to be her lover but kills her when he finds out she is cheating and not with him). Oh and sheâs doing this with her best friend Daya who happens to work for ZADE doing illegal hacking stuff.Anyways..the book ENDS with ZADE and Jay having a gun to their heads because the underground ritual was a setup and also Adeline was taken by two mafia guys at the request of Max. Sooo I will have to read Hunting Adeline to find out what happens.Ending Thoughts: The way this ends makes it seem like Max is the one threatening Jay and ZADE during the ritual after the explosion, especially since he was the one who sent for Adeline to be extracted. Also, does the little girl and Michael survive? I hope they were able to get out. And Daya.. she had to be taken too since she wasnât answering her phone. Oh boy ZADE is going to be PISSED!!!",book
"Okay so I was worried that this book had too much hype and wouldn't be good. It also came with so many trigger warnings I though it would be hard to read.First let me say yes there are dark themes like child trafficking and very dark romantic kinks, but it doesn't go into enough detail really to warrant the extreme triggers people talk about. I've read fantasy dark romances that have more blood and sadistic tendencies with more descriptions.With that being said, I couldn't put it down. The alternating POV is perfect and the storyline is fantastic so if you removed or skimmed over the spicy scenes due to uncomfortable, the book would still grab your attention.Only reason I'm giving it 4.5 instead of 5 stars is because I got annoyed with Adeline's back and forth on her feelings and the damn foreshadowing of a pregnancy. PEOPLE CAN LIVE HAPPILY EVER AFTER WITHOUT CHILDREN!!!!!!!",book
This book absolutely broke me. My moral compass is so confused and oddly I'm okay with it. I'm writing this review after reading books 1 and 2 as well as Satan's Affair. I do recommend reading the books in order starting with the novella as you are introduced to Sibby & Zade. The timelines will make sense and questions will be answered in the Haunting Adeline.I enjoyed the love story between Adeline and Zade as well as the sub plot with Adeline finding her grandmothers letters and learning she had a stalker as well. I liked that it wasn't instalove and she actually took her time with Zade. The spice in this book is insane. I learned things about myself to say the least LOL. Check TWs as there are heavy topics which only increases in book 2. This book was absolutely an experience and one of my favorite books.If you have never read a dark romance before I wouldn't recommend starting with this duet.,book
"#HauntingAdeline book one by #HDCarlton comes in with a strong 4/5. The book starts with sharing a playlist and a trigger warning (see third picture for all sensitive content). This is a wonderful cat and mouse game between author Adeline Reilly and her mysterious stalker âZâ. Filled with intrigue, murder, and extra spice, the book carries you through to end on a massive cliffhanger. I would definitely recommend having the second and final book on hand. The only complaint I have is that in several places seemed clipped and cut short â a little choppy. Other than that itâs a good book and I would definitely recommend.",book
"Can I just say, I had no idea that I would ever be reading a book like this. As a writer myself, I was sucked in by the authors words. I almost felt as though, Adeline, was really H.D. Carlton in disguise! she really is, the manipulator.Spoiler Alert!!!!!Adeline and Zade, they are kind of perfect for each other.Adeline is strong willed and outspoken. She has no problem saying how she feels. She tends to do this throughout the first book. Her smart mouth lands her into a lot of trouble, and I must say, I am intrigued, because I am that way myself.Zade is a self made man. He works to rectify the injustices of human trafficking, and despite being noble and striving to change the world, he becomes infatuated with our girl Adeline. Obsession at first sight.I loved the cat and mouse chase, it was perfect and like I said, I couldn't put it down!Character development is my number one thing in books, I cannot stand a romance book that has zero character development and just mindless sex scenes. But haunting went above and beyond my expectations.I loved the back story, and the inclusion of the past with the present. Adeline's curiosity about her grandmothers death, the diary, her history with her mother. It was so easy to follow, despite being loaded with details that anyone can easily miss. In fact, I reread the book a second time, and then caved and got the audiobook which has the best voice narrators! (if I may add, I normally HATE the audiobook versions of books, mainly because I find that the voice narrators, give the characters no personality and their performance feels so dry, it makes me not want to finish listening, but the voice narrators selected for this book.....oh my lord.....)Haunting, was the type of read where I found myself questioning a lot of things, mainly with myself and my own tastes. I never thought I would be able to read such a dark book but wow. I was entrapped.I have purchased Hunting Adeline, and cannot wait to dive into the next one.",book
"Verity opens with author Lowen Ashleigh having a very bad morning. Her mother died the previous week after a year-long battle with colon cancer. Lowen had a difficult relationship with her mother -- ""a direct result of my own mother being terrified of me,"" she relates -- but still brought her to Lowen's apartment and cared for her during the last nine months of her life. Lowen is a sleepwalker and her mother kept her fairly secluded as a child, afraid of what Lowen might be capable of doing during one of many sleepwalking episodes. Now she has left her apartment in New York City for the first time in weeks, summoned to a meeting at her publisher's office by her literary agent, Corey, with whom she was previously in an intimate relationship. Just as Lowen is waiting for a crosswalk light to change, a man steps into the street and is struck by a truck. Lowen is understandably shaken, and the man's blood is splattered on her face and white shirt.A handsome stranger escorts her into a coffee shop bathroom and literally gives her the shirt off his back. They chat briefly, and Loewn concludes that he ""wants to be invisible in this city. Just like me."" After all, she moved to New York to become part of the city's invisible millions of invisible residents. Her books have not sold well enough for her publisher to offer her another contract unless she agrees to promote them, something she has refused to do in the past. ""I'm so awkward I'm afraid once my readers meet me in person, they'll swear off my books forever,"" Lowen laments. ""That's why I stay home and write. I think the idea of me is better than the reality of me."" But another contract was her last hope. She took time off from her writing career believing that her mother would leave her some money. Now, having lived off the advance she received after signing her prior contract, she has learned that she will receive nothing from her mother's estate. And be homeless soon, unless she receives a job offer.When Lowen arrives at her publisher's office, she is shocked to find the man whose shirt she is wearing is attending the same meeting. He is Jeremy Crawford, husband of Verity, a very successful author who is unable to complete the series of books she was writing. Lowen is being offered a flat fee of seventy-five thousand dollars per book to write the last three volumes in the series, with the first installment due in six months. Lowen is determined to turn down the offer until Jeremy informs her that he selected her because Verity read one of Lowen's books and it was among her favorites. She purportedly told Jeremy that they shared a similar writing style and Lowen was destined to be ""the next big thing."" Verity has been catastrophically injured in a motor vehicle accident, following the deaths of both of her daughters, Chastin and Harper, leaving Jeremy to raise their young son, Crew, alone. Lowen ultimately agrees to take on the project.Lowen makes the six-hour drive to the Crawford home in Vermont, listening to the audio version of the first book in the series en route. She is to spend time in Verity's office, reviewing the research and notes she left there in order to assess how best to approach writing the next book. Lowen meets Crew and learns that Verity's condition is extremely serious. She is in a virtually catatonic state -- uncommunicative and unable to care for herself. Caregivers spend the day in the home, with Jeremy managing at night. Lowen soon discovers that Verity's office lacks organization -- her expansive desk is strewn with stacks from end to end with papers and files, and boxes containing more documents line the walls. Clearly, the process of sorting through it all will take much longer than Lowen originally anticipated. As she begins reading Verity's second book, she realizes the ""books are from the villain's point of view"" and she will need ""time to work myself into that mindset while writing."" Jeremy claims that he has never read Verity's books because he ""didn't like being inside her head.""Author Colleen Hoover recounts Lowen's story via a first-person narrative, with the story really taking off as Lowen attempts to settles into the Crawford home. She is keenly observant and inquisitive about Verity's writing, as well as her family, and quickly finds herself attracted to Jeremy, who is still married to the incapacitated woman being cared for in an upstairs bedroom. Searching through Verity's office, Lowen stumbles upon a manuscript entitled ""So Be It."" Verity hopes it is an outline for the next book, but it is instead an autobiography drafted by Verity. Reading it is not what she has been hired to do, but she justifies her insatiable curiosity by construing her review of the manuscript as research. ""I need to see how Verity's mind works to understand her as a writer."" Soon she is absorbed in Verity's descriptions of meeting Jeremy, the development of their relationship and the early days of their marriage, as well as her pregnancies and motherhood. The more she reads, the more frightened of Verity Lowen becomes, especially when events she observes appear to be inconsistent with what she has been told about Verity's condition. Nonetheless, Lowen continues returning to the manuscript to better understand the Crawford family's history, and gain insight into Jeremy and Verity's marriage. But Lowen is playing a dangerous game. Verity's purported autobiography is a dark and disturbing confession of Verity's feelings, motivations, and unspeakably vile acts. Lowen believes the manuscript to be an accurate depiction of Verity's life, and concludes that it ""was written by a very disturbed woman -- a woman whose house I currently inhabit.""Hoover ramps up the tension as Lowen becomes entangled in a budding relationship with Jeremy, influenced heavily by what she is reading in the manuscript. Verity's revelations are horrifying, and as Lowen and Jeremy grow closer, he increasingly opens up to her, sharing details of his life with Verity about which Lowen feigns ignorance. Lowen's suspicions about the accident in which Verity was injured grow. Is Jeremy being completely honest with Lowen? Why is he willing to embark on a new relationship with Lowen when his wife, although injured, is still alive? He claims that he cannot move Verity to a care facility because Crew cannot sustain another loss. While Verity is cared for in their home, Crew can spend unlimited amounts of time at her bedside. Lowen now possesses detailed information about the deaths of Jeremy's daughters. Were their deaths really tragic accidents? Is Crew safe?Hoover's characters are both fascinating and infuriating. The story is related solely from Lowen's perspective. Her childhood was difficult because of her sleepwalking and the way it detrimentally impacted her relationship with her mother. She has achieved modest success as a writer, but because of her discomfort in social situations, her career growth has been stymied. She accepts the offer to write Verity's next three books because she desperately needs the money, but also because it is an opportunity too good to pass up. But she is confused not only by her burgeoning attraction to Jeremy, but the incongruity between what she has been told about Verity's accident and what transpires in the house. Of course, Lowen's feelings and experiences are colored by the information set forth in the manuscript. Interestingly, Hoover has said that even when she depicts Lowen reading Verity's manuscript, readers are ""still not fully in Verityâs head because weâre always in Lowenâs perspective, reading something she found. When I write a book from one characterâs point of view, I rarely think about the story from the other characterâs perspectives. Sometimes itâs necessary for certain scenes, but with this book, it was important for me to feel the confusion and fear Lowen felt. So as the author, I had to be completely blind to what was happening from everyone else's perspectives."" Still, as the story progresses, Hoover keeps readers guessing as to how gullible and vulnerable Lowen really is. She believes the manuscript is truthful and accurate, and that Jeremy is not the villain -- if, in fact there is a villain in the Crawfords' story. But could Lowen possibly be opportunistic, calculating, and willing to do anything to be with Jeremy?Jeremy is equally captivating. He is handsome, charming, successful, and by all outward appearances, a family man who has sustained unimaginable losses who has been able to soldier on only because he has a young son to raise. To be fair, although Verity's prognosis is never affirmatively established, his desire to move on with his life is understandable -- Verity sustained a serious head injury which will, in all likelihood, preclude her from resuming a fully normal life. But was his meeting with Lowen on the street just before the meeting at her publisher's office really just coincidental? Did he intend for her to find the manuscript in Verity's office? Has he been fully aware of its contents all along? About that, Hoover says, ""Iâm not sure because I was never in Jeremyâs head."" In other words, readers can draw their own conclusions, based on the evidence Hoover does present.And what about Verity? Is she selfishly conniving and evil, as the manuscript suggests? Or is she a blameless grieving mother who was tragically injured in a horrific car accident?The manuscript provides myriad complications. Lowen debates whether she should discuss it with Jeremy. She doesn't believe he is aware of its existence or content. He claimed he never read Verity's books, after all. Lowen learns that Verity was injured when her vehicle hit a tree, but there were no skidmarks on the pavement. She concludes Verity ""either fell asleep or she did it on purpose."" Does it matter to Lowen which scenario is accurate? What conclusion has Jeremy drawn about the cause of the accident?Putting aside the perspective from which the story is told, no aspect of the story or the characters can be accepted at face value. Hoover includes plot twists so shocking and unnerving that Verity, originally published in 2018, continues to be one of the most-discussed psychological thrillers ever written. (There is even a Facebook discussion group devoted to the book, boasting nearly twenty-five thousand members!) The book is fast-paced, engrossing, and extremely entertaining. The story's pace gradually accelerates with each surprising development and breath-taking revelations of the truth or, perhaps, a manipulated version of the truth. The tale careens to a jaw-dropping conclusion that will keep readers thinking, discussing, and debating Hoover's extremely clever and nuanced tale, as well as her deliciously intriguing and morally ambiguous characters (who may prove themselves to be not as ambiguous as originally thought) for a very, very long time. Hoover says she ""chose the ending because itâs frightening to me. Itâs my biggest nightmare For the darkness in the worlds I create as a writer to somehow"" intrude into her real life.Thanks to Grand Central Publishing for a copy of the book.",book

"I cannot remember the last time that a book consumed my attention. It was most likely when I was in 8th grade and the first Harry Potter book came out.The writing is easy to read and transports you in a way that you feel like you are standing right there with the main character. Almost as if you could see yourself acting and responding the same way she does.The plot keeps you on your toes and guessing even after the last chapter has ended. I would highly recommend this book for a monthly book club pick. There is so much to dissect and discuss. And, I dare say many readers would have a variety of opinions on what the actual truth is.On a more tangible note, the book itself a light and paperback. The text is a good size and easy to read. The paper used is thin and you can see pigment coming through the backside of the page, which is not my preference. However, it did not take away from my reading overall. In addition, the book can be held open easily unlike many books where if you laid it down it would immediately close on itself.Do yourself a favor and grab a copy. You won't regret it.",book
"I knew this one was supposed to me twisty and a mind...flip, so I was waiting it for it throughout. But it wasn't the things I had predicted in my guesses, though! I loved this book and was on the edge of my seat through the majority of the story. The characters, setting, romance, steam, suspense, and mystery were all perfect AND perfectly balanced...which I find to be a difficult task in a romantic suspense/mystery book.

"I read this over a leisurely weekend and found it to be a page turner of unexpected twists and turns. The storyline is exciting and original. I usually don't read psychological thrillers because the dark notes of evil minds repel my senses and there is plenty of that accosting us in the real world. However, this was complex enough to hold my attention without being overly dark. I was intrigued and couldn't put it down. However, the reliance on too many descriptive sex scenes got old.

That was my mindset when I started the book. Feyre was nothing but selfish in âA Court of Thorns and Roseâ and oh, did she make my blood boil. And even in this book, I was like that as wellâ¦but thatâs an explanation for later. Because I truly enjoyed this story! So much that I have a picture of Velaris as my wallpaper on my phone.I didnât want to give Tiktok the credit. I DEFINITELY didnât want to jump on the bandwagon of this series. But why am I on Etsy about to buy a shirt that says âWingspan Mattersâ? Why are there Velaris stickers in my cart? And why is Rhysand so damn irresistible???Iâm doomed. Iâm drinking the kool-aid and I donât even remember it coming into my hand. Ohâ¦god.In this second book of the series, we continue to follow Feyre after she saves Prythian from that crazy red headed demon woman with blue balls for Tamlin (lol) and she gets to head home with her flower beast man, but realizes that life as the soon-to-be wife of the High Lord of Spring Court is not what she thought it would be. Everyday was boring, soul shattering, depressing, and a prison. But the only freedom she has is that one week of the month with Rhysand at the Night Court. The story progresses as Feyre finds her strength in herself and others, learns not to judge a book by its cover, and that family (even if itâs found) and love (when is deep and true) is worth dying for.You see there? I spoke highly of the girl! Because GOD DAMN was she killing me all ACOTAR and up to Chapter 34 in ACOMAF. Feyreâs absolute selfishness and denial is so insufferable that I had to put the book down, walk away, and scream into a pillow. She is a walking billboard for âpity partiesâ and âmisery loves companyâ. She is manipulative and honestly a liability. She only cares about herself and what others can do to benefit her. She doesnât want to understand people but wants people to understand her. Pot meet Kettle. I donât like Feyre. I AM VERY ANTI FEYRE.But holy smoke, am I loving her journey! The world building and character development is absolutely amazing. Maas knows how to write a book! I literally am transported to this world when I read like Iâm watching a movie on a big screen. I have fallen in love with the characters (even Nesta!). I am envious of the beauty and danger of this world. I am absolutely desperate to pick up the next book in the series and keep going and going and going. This series is fantastic so far. Fantastic!When it comes to favorite characters, I will have to say Rhysand the one. How well written is this man that you feel his pain and pure desperation to save his found family and city. To stand up for the people around him and build a home and community heâs proud of. Plus he is sexy as hell! Take ME far away so I can hear that roar. But that pain in MY hair! Also, Amrenâ¦oooooo yâall look out for her! Badass incarnate and I can not WAIT to see what she is and where she came from.Also another favorite for me in this books is the Summer Court scenes. Tarquin, though not a massive part in this book, is a man you can easily fall in love with. Dark skin and white hair amongst a beautiful never ending summer lane. Loved it! I could literally smell the salt air and hear the gulls. The beauty described filled my mind and the chaos of the situation/mission made my heart pound with excitement and awe.So yea, I may be a Feyre haterâ¦but it has not stopped me from seeing the vision Maas is showing in the ACOTAR series. I can say I will probably love Feyre by the end of it all. She shows signs of hope. But man, am I invested in this world! Take me away, Ms. Maas. I want to be a part of the world you have created again soon.",book

"o I LOVED this book, along with every other reader. However, itâs not my favorite book in the series (Iâm writing this online review after completing the series BUT from the notes I took while reading for the first time).o We certainly do love a Rhysand show, donât we? We all made the mistake of liking Tamlin in the first book, youâre not alone. I love Rhysâ character so much. Brooding, bad boy with the good reasons. We love that.o OVERVIEW: SPOILERS. Feyre returned to the Spring Court with Tamlin. Only to find that Tamlin had become so overprotective of her she wasnât allowed to leave the manor. So she stayed there planning for everything with Ianthe, the priestess that Tamlin had brought in. Planning the wedding, planning the flowers, things that she couldnât have cared any less about. We find Feyre falling more and more into the darkness. However, while she is there fighting with Tamlin on everything, Rhysand shows up to make good on his bargain after 3 months of peace where everyone assumed heâd forgotten about it. Although she doesnât want to go, she does. And there, she learns to read and write because Rhys saw in the trials that she couldnât. He teaches her with sentences like âRhysand is the most handsome high lordâ, and the like. We love that for him & his twisted sense of humor and narcissism.o However, Feyre captures a Suriel (our favorite gossip queen) and he tells her âStay with the High Lord and see everything rightedâ So, the day of the wedding of Tamlin and Feyre (feeling like she is doing as the Suriel told her) comes and she has a hideous dress that she hates on that Ianthe picked out. As she is walking own the isle toward Tamlin she is silently shouting in her head for ANYONE to stop it. She is beginning to panic. And a special dark knight in shining armor shows up just in time as Feyre stopped in the aisle because she couldnât go any further. Rhys then whisks her away.o There she decides that she is not returning to the Spring Court and being locked in that house.o So begins Feyreâs real healing at Velaris and the Night Court.o I did indeed love this book so much. Feyreâs internal struggle just fractured my heart throughout the entire thing. Her spiraling into despair and Tamlin not noticing but Rhys noticing that she was coming to him during his weeks, frail and full of nothing was so amazing.o Watching their characters develop a relationship was amazing. I understand why this book is the favorite of the ENTIRE series.",book
"I really debated rating this one higher cause I gave ACOTAR four stars and I definitely liked this one better, but it didnât quite feel like a 4.5 or 5 star read. Iâm so consistent ðANYWAY, getting into my actual thoughtsâ¦where do I find myself an Illyrian? Like, for real. How is it that Rhys, Cassian, AND Azriel are all the ACTUAL BEST.Following the trend Iâve seen, I love Rhys, and Tamlin can go rot in hell. Thatâs how much I disliked him in this book. I loved seeing how much Under the Mountain affected Feyre, and I really liked all of her interactions with the Inner Circle. The Inner Circle in general is like actually the best part of this book.THE. TENSION. is so freaking good. I think the tension itself was better than the spice (though the spice was ð¶ï¸ ð¥µð), but only because the tension was soooo damn good. Itâs like 300 pages of tension and buildup and I was dying. But loving it. Obviously.It was such a great fantasy read to jump into and finish within like 48 hours. Though I am kicking myself for not having ACOWAR already in my house before I finished this one. Definitely make sure you have the whole series ready.Spoiler talk:I wasnât a fan of Elaine and Lucien being mates. Like, first of all, I didnât love Lucien in this one, but also it just felt too ironic. And Feyre has the same thought, but it doesnât make it better ðIâm feeling a Nesta and Cassian mates plot line?? I donât hate it, but it still feels weird that all three sisters randomly have mates that are in close proximity to each other.Mor and Azriel >>>The ending felt weird and maybe a little rushed? Idk, the book just felt like a McGuffin, I donât understand the deal with the Cauldron, and I donât know how much I love that Feyre and Rhys were able to trick the big bad villain so easily. It was just meh.Also, what is with SJM and intentionally holding back major plot points from readers just to surprise us?? I was somewhat okay with it when it was just Aelin doing it in ToG, but Iâm not a fan of it here. Iâd rather know their plan and feel the suspense of âcan they pull it off??â than being blindsided.",book
"** Warning: This is NOT a spoiler-free review like I usually write. I wonât give away twists from the very end but I WILL be discussing things that happened throughout the beginning and middle of the book! **I was pleasantly surprised when I read A COURT OF THORNS AND ROSES last year because going into it, I knew it was a story with a strong fae presence. By this point in time in my reading career, I wasnât new to fantasy but I was still a bit picky about what sort of fantasy I liked and fae did not fall into that category of selected themesâ¦ But knowing how much I loved Sarahâs Throne of Glass series and the fae presence there, I dove into ACOTAR and loved it! It had a bit of a BREAKING DAWN ending so I wasnât quite sure where the second book would go but naturally I had very, very high hopes for it since I hadnât been let down by a Maas book yet!I wonât sugar coat it â it actually took me a really long time to get into the swing of this book. I was enjoying the plot but the beginning felt so incredibly dramatic and I just didnât feel like things were moving forward. There was a lot of time spent on Feyreâs PTSD from her time Under the Mountain and I absolutely understand and donât think that her traumatic experience should be just brushed over. I do felt like there was too much time dwelling on it though. ACOMAF isnât a short book and I think some pages could have been saved and still gotten the point across throughout a few sections in the beginning. If the book were more character-based instead of plot-driven, it might have been more appropriate but the plot really seemed to suffer because of this and this isnât the first time I felt this way in a Maas book either. I understand that these characters have gone through something that truly does change them but I felt like I was reading about totally different characters when I started ACOMAF. Feyre and Tamlin were just not themselves and I think had ACOTAR ended with a bit more of this shadow or if it had slowly creeped in throughout ACOMAF, it wouldnât have been as much of a surprise. I just really felt like I was thrown into a totally new environment and it was really hard for me to adjust to, especially since I had read ACOTAR over a year before I got to start ACOMAF.I continued to have issues with Feyre throughout the book. I donât know why but she was just really bothering me. Instead of snarky, witty comebacks, I felt like everything with her was taken as an insult and she was constantly being defensive and kind of hated everyone. It was really hard to watch her interact with characters and I started to latch onto new (or new-to-the-spotlight) characters like Rhysand and his gang. It did make me extra thankful for Rhys coming onto the scene and shaking things up, though! The interactions between Feyre and Tamlin were just unbearable and painful to read. Then I ended up on the flip side where although I didnât want Feyre and Tamlin to still be together, I also felt really weird that Tamlin was almost totally absent from this book. He was there in the beginning and I wonât speak of the ending but this book was straight up about Feyre and Rhysand and it almost felt like a waste that we spent all that time building up a romance between Feyre and Tamlin in ACOTAR to have it totally change. I absolutely love where it went but itâs confusing to understand why the Feyre/Tamlin romance was so important and developed in ACOTAR and why Rhysand wasnât more of a main character throughout that courtship to really get his foot even more in the door.Iâve followed the romances in Sarah J. Maasâ books quite well, I think, considering theyâre not always simple and straightforward. I know some people who have issues with love triangles or already have their OTPs with the first love interest really have trouble moving with the characters as they fall out of love or move from one interest to realize that their true match is someone else and I feel like Iâve followed along with that fairly easily. I can see where people feel like the romance in ACOMAF is a love triangle and I guess to a certain extent it is, but Feyre also does not have interest in both men at the same time. It is quite complicated though so if youâre sensitive about triangles, you almost definitely wonât like the romance.I personally loved the development of Rhysand as a love interest, especially once Feyre really started to struggle with Tamlin. I found it telling that at the hardest points in their lives, Feyre and Tamlin drifted apart and just couldnât find a way to even communicate instead of being able to rely on one another and get through a hard time together. That doesnât always mean that you shouldnât be with someone but in the case of story telling, itâs a pretty big sign that the main character isnât where they should be. Iâve heard this complaint from other Maas readers but this is the first of her books where I really felt like the romance started to take over the book. While I did love the new Rhysand/Feyre development, I felt like there was a lot of back and forth between them before anything major (finally) happened and that could have been cut down to some more meaningful interactions instead of repetitive, similar situations that happened more than a few times throughout the course of the story. Their romance actually is a very important part of the plot so itâs not like I wanted it to be downplayed but I just felt like so many points of the large general story were pushed aside to develop the romantic moments and it started to turn more romance story than epic fantasy â and yes, there are some cheesy romance book-worthy moments. Letâs just say this is NOT A YOUNG ADULT BOOK, friends. There are some very explicit scenes so if you have teens or are directing/teaching teens who are reading this series, you may not want to put this book directly into their hands. (Not that Iâm saying censor them but. Ya know. Read it first so you know what youâre giving them.)The sections where the plot progressed were really quite delightful. Sarah J. Maas is still a master at layering stories and itâs so interesting to see how much of a previous book comes back in a different light in a subsequent book. There were so many moments that the reader is able to recognize from ACOMAF and see from a different characterâs perspective or reassess it with more information and it makes the story that much deeper! Once things started to really take off around halfway through and a little thereafter, the book was simply addicting and I couldnât wait to see where the entire plot of the series was going! Sarah really does have an amazing ability to craft an overall series arc and itâs so fun to watch that develop. The ending positively floored me and it was hard to remember why I had been so frustrated for a while throughout earlier sections of the book. So many things were revealed, actions taken, and trusts betrayed that I just really didnât know what was coming. The twists and surprises were epic and once again, I was left in utter anticipation of the next book!",book
"*Review originally posted on Goodreads*âI was not a pet, not a doll, not an animal. I was a survivor, and I was strong. I would not be weak, or helpless again. I would not, could not be broken. Tamed.âA Court of Thorns and Roses was one of the first books I started reading that got me into Fantasy and reviewing books. Way back when this series, the Throne of Glass series, and Sarah J. Maas, herself, wasn't hyped up like there's no tomorrow. It was the first book I've read by Sarah J. Maas and the reason I picked up the Throne of Glass series because I just needed more SJM in my life.I was satisfied with the way things ended in ACOTAR so when I heard that some ""changes"" were going to be made in A Court of Mist and Fury, I was a little disappointed. I was NOT a fan of the changes that were made in the Throne of Glass series which was why I haven't picked up Queen of Shadows yet even though the book has been sitting on my shelf since the day it's been released. That's just my opinion. I know some SJM fans are going to start pouncing because they sincerely believe that Sarah could absolutely do no wrong. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE SARAH J. MAAS. She is an outstanding author. I love her writing, her characters, and the world that she brings to life. It was her books that changed my perspective on Young Adult Fantasy, but I honestly wouldn't say that I agree with every direction that SJM takes with her books.I suppose the questions to ask now are: what was my stance at the end of ACOTAR and how did I perceive the changes that were made after reading ACOMAF?Let me address the most important aspect of Sarah J. Maas's books, this series, and probably the thing that majority of readers care about the most: THE ROMANCE. Since A Court of Thorns and Roses was a loose retelling of Beauty and the Beast, my ship of course was none other than Tamlin and Feyre. I loved them as individuals and I loved them even more as a couple. AND I loved Rhysand. Just not as a love interest. I felt like Feyre wasn't worthy of the enigma that was Rhysand. But knowing the trend that SJM follows in all of her books, I figured a change in love interests was inevitable. After all, a book isn't written by Sarah J. Maas if there isn't some character butchering and changes in love interests involved.But after reading A Court of Mist and Fury, I actually found myself accepting the transition in love interests much to my surprise. As much as I wanted Tamlin and Feyre to stay together, I knew it wasn't going to happen. These two people that survived weren't the same people that were Under the Mountain. They're relationship became such a nightmare and so unhealthy. It was two damaged lovers waiting for a disaster to happen.In the beginning of this series, I understood where Tamlin was coming from and why he was so protective of Feyre. It was for Feyre's own good and nobody wants to lose the people they love and/or care about. But he took it way too far. He became too overbearing to the point where he was holding Feyre back. We all understood the trials and suffering that Feyre had to go through but I feel like people don't acknowledge what Tamlin had to go through as well while they were Under the Mountain. It was nothing close to what Feyre had to go through but Tamlin had to watch the person he loved suffer and die. He couldn't protect her the way he wanted and he didn't fight for her as he knew he very well could have. He was helpless and a coward. I think he realized this, which was why he tried to make up for it afterwards by protecting her now to the point where she's being suffocated. It still doesn't excuse what Tamlin does in this book but he's just another damaged character like Feyre and Rhysand. He's just hurting in different ways and expressing that pain in a way the he views would make up for his shortcomings in the first book. Tamlin loves Feyre, that much is evident. He just loves her too much, and that is the tragedy.As for Rhysand, all I can say is that I loved him in ACOTAR and I loved him even more in A Court of Mist and Fury. I loved that we finally get a good understanding of Rhys as a character, the secrets he's kept, and the sacrifices he's made for the good of his people and his court. He was everything that Tamlin was not and twice the man and High Lord that Tamlin will ever be. I'm not completely sure if I'm 100% on board with Feyre and Rhysand yet but I love their chemistry, friendship, and the way they just understand and respect one another. I think I would've been head over heels in love with Feyre and Rhys instantly as a couple if ACOTAR never happened and I didn't get so attached to Feyre and Tamlin. But I no longer ship Tamlin/Feyre and I'm slowly, but surely, beginning to fall in love with Rhysand and Feyre little by little.With romance aside, everything about A Court of Mist and Fury turned out every bit as great as I anticipated a year ago. Sarah J. Maas did not disappoint. I was preparing myself for the worst but instead I got the best. Sarah really knows how to capture her audience with her writing, worldbuilding, and characters that she has created. Of all the new things that were introduced in this book, the new characters of the Night Court were definitely my favorite. I thought the Spring Court was great in ACOTAR with characters like Lucien and Alis but the Night Court was at a whole new level with Cassian, Azriel, Morrigan, and Amren. BADASS is literally an understatement describing these new characters.Besides Rhysand and Feyre, ACOMAF introduced so many new ships and I can't handle all the perfectness that everyone is. I now ship Mor and Azriel with all of my being, just putting it out there. XD And Cassian and Nesta. And Lucian and Elain. None for you Tamlin.Overall, I was glad I waited to read A Court of Mist and Fury because as a result, I was able to dive into the story with an open mind about the changes that were going to be made in terms of romance and the direction that Sarah J. Maas was taking the series. Love her or hate her, Sarah can write one hell of a story and is such an outstanding author. Although there were some parts of the book that went by a little slow, I think A Court of Mist and Fury was even better than ACOTAR in more ways than one. Sometimes I find that sequels may suffer ""middle book syndrome"" but ACOMAF amplifies that momentum knowing that Sarah is preparing to hurtle anticipation and suffering our way for the conclusion of the A Court of Thorns and Roses trilogy.",book
"Iâm in love.ACOMAF is a wonderful continuation of Feyreâs story that continues to build out the absolutely stunning world Maas has created. The expansion of the world is easy to follow but deliciously detailed as it expands our horizons literally and figuratively. The pace of world building is easy enough for a reader new to Fantasy to follow, but not too slow for an avid Fantasy reader.The character development EXPLODES in this book leading to extremely satisfying realizations, twists, and turns for both the reader and the characters. We finally get some relationship dynamics we didnât even know we were missing in ACOTAR!Just like ACOTAR, there were moments where my emotions got the best of me while reading ACOMAF. I feel physical reactions to some of the scenes, truly engulfing me in the story!ACOTAR and ACOMAF continue to tighten their claws around me as I dive headfirst into the next book!âTo the stars who listenâand the dreams that are answered.â",book
"I loved everything about this book and it was better than the first bookIMO. There's so much action, friendship, and relationship build up.There's so much we learn about the Night Court and about Rhys. Not only do we see Feyre learn and grow into her fae powers, we also see her relationship grow with Rhys as well. We are also introduced to the close friends of Rhys's which brings out a whole new side of him.There was a lot of tension and build up to the spicy parts of this book. Even though the author goes into detail in maybe 2 to 3 spicy scenes, it was what we all were waiting for between Feyre and Rhys. For that I will rate it a 3 for spice.",book
"This is the first series in my life that I cannot have any sort of break between books. I finished the fist one and was ready this one within the hour. I havenât been this captivated, this involved, this in love, this heated (cause holy moly I was squirming towards the end), this heartbroken, by a book before as I am with this. I was WAITING for Rhys and Feyre to finally take they next step and they would get SO close and I would get so excited but then they would hold off again, leaving me all flustered. But what an ending!!I love the family that Feyre finally has in this book, the love and respect they have for one another is what anyone wants in their group of friends and to see Feyre come from such trauma and sadness into a world of protection without suffocation, adoration for who she is as a person, not just because of what made her into High Fae, the support and encouragement, itâs nothing short of heart wrenching when you yourself don't have that kind of group in your life.I already finished this one and I am already on the third. I cant wait to keep reading this series. I have a feeling Iâll put the 5th book down, pick up the first, and start all over again just so I dont ever have to believe itâs over ðððð¥ð¥ð¥ð¥",book
"This book was everything I had hoped it would, and SO MUCH more! I loved it as much as I love Rhysland. There, I said it. There's romance, sensuality, character growth, action, betrayal, friendships, family ties, and so much more. The character developments, the story telling, the world building, and the way Maas wrote this story is AWESOME! This book is the packaged deal. Okay, I'll admit it, Rhysand is the packaged deal in this book.I knew there was much more to Rhysand than we got to know in A Court of Thorns and Roses. Boy is there a lot more to him! I loved the way I got to know him in this book. Maas held things back from readers, allowing us to get to know Rhysand as Feyre got to know him. Part of that is what made it easier to fall in love with his character. The more I got to know him, the easier it was for me to really see him for who he was, and in turn made it easy to see the differences between him and Tamlin. Rhysland is that character you want on your side. He's loyal to those close to him, doesn't apologize for who he really is, doesn't hold back when it comes to loving a certain someone, and unlike some characters, he sees Feyre for all that she really is, and allows her to be who she is, and all that she's becoming.Despite the fact he can make anyone do anything he wants, Rhysland gives Feyre choices, and allows her to make them. He wants her to be who she wants to be. Rhysand a character that readers will get to see all sides of, and fall in love with in the process. I love the way he treats Feyre, and his court. He's very powerful, someone to fear, yet for all the darkness that resides within him, I came to understand how the darkness he has calms and brings peace to Feyre. He is that person who isn't only compassionate and loyal when it comes to his court, he's someone who knows how to treat to a woman. He treats Feyre with so much love, respect and understanding. *sigh* Just wait until you see how he treats her... you won't be able to resist falling for him either. I've completely fallen in love with his character.Feyre by all means is an equal to Rhys. Not only did I love their banter, electric chemistry, and those hot scenes between them ( I swear the pages ignited in this book more than a few times), I loved how she fell for Rhysand. The more I got to know him, the more I understood how she slowly started to fall for him. It was natural and made sense. Most importantly, I loved that she realized she is worth so much more than she's ever thought. I loved that she grew into a strong, fierce character/women who not only learned to love herself, but love someone who truly loved her, and didn't want to keep her in a cage. I loved that she learned to fight, and embrace her powers, both literally and figuratively. She grew so much, and I loved that she became a force to reckon with. What I admired the most about Feyre's character development in this book, is that she learned to love herself. She learned to embrace who she is, and all that she is. I respected her even more for that.The romance and character chemistry in this book was on fire! The banter, and flirting between Rhysand and Feyre was, well that's just say these two know how to push each other's buttons, and get under each other's skin in all the right ways. Together, Feyre and Rhysland are something amazing. Aside from all the physical aspects, and passion these two share, I love that they chase away the darkness that threatens to consume the other. They both have experienced horrific things that they are still dealing with. They are each other's hope, and light. They're there for each other and help pull each other out of the darkness, or sometimes are there to hold the other as they endure the nightmares.One of the things I liked about theme of love in this book, is the way Feyre came to realize what it truly meant to be loved and be in love, vs what she thought love was. I appreciated the fact that Maas doesn't just tell her readers this, she shows us through character actions. We see it through Feyre's realization of what Rhysand's been telling her, and how he treats her vs how Tamlin treats her. Tamlin's fall from grace is that he didn't respect Feyre enough to allow her to be herself. He didn't treat her like an equal, but instead wanted keep her locked up and in his possession. I may have got the 'why' in that, but I didn't agree with it at all. The contrast between how Rhysand and Tamlin both treated Feyre was painfully obvious through out the book.Maas has a way with creating in-depth characters I really come to care about. She effortlessly brings them to life, as well as their stories, and vividly detailed worlds. I loved getting to go deeper into the Fey world, being introduced to more characters, and seeing the different parts of their world. I loved getting to know the Night Court. Maas has always created characters that really add depth to the story, and the Night Court was no different. I loved meeting and getting to know Rhys's inner circle. These characters weren't only friends, they are family, and it really showed in their story. Along with the Night Court, which has become my favorite court, I loved seeing more of the other characters, and learning about their histories, and ties together with their courts. I felt every range of emotion possible while reading this book. I laughed, I cried, I cheered, I swooned, got swept off my feet, was happy, angry (at a certain someone), and I completely fell in love with all that this book offered me. I officially have a book hang over. Sarah J. Maas what have you done to me?! The turn of events, the character developments, and the over all story are that good! I feel bad for the next book I read after this one, because I already had to re-read this book once, because it was so good. I don't even know what else I can say, other than, that is one heck of an awesome sequel! Now the torture will be waiting a whole another for the next book!*There are sensual scenes, and well written sex scenes through out the book, as well as the use of the f-word a few times through out the book, making it a book that may not be suitable for younger YA readers.",book
"Released in 2023, The Creative Act: A Way of Being by Rick Rubin is a bible of highly quotable material that all artists should read.Rubin, a music producer of such acts including The Beastie Boys, Red Hot Chili Peppers, and even Jay-Z, is like a zen master. His expertise lies in what he hears and how he is able to suggest and or push an artist to dig deeper or go father, or think differently than they currently doâjust think of him as an oracle.The creative act, as the title states, can refer to whatever type of âartâ you are studying or producing. Whether you are a musician, photographer, painter, or designer, it doesnât matter. Every single thing he discusses within this book applies. I found it to be one of the best books that I have ever read on the subject of creativity. It should be a required reading book for anyone in art school or trying to master a given craft.Each chapter is short and covers a variety of topics including: Creativity, Awareness, Self-Doubt, Experimentation, Momentum, and Success, just to name a few. Here are just a handful of great quotes that I found inspiring. I hope you read this book and become inspired too!âThe objective is not to learn to mimic greatness, but to calibrate our internal meter for greatness. So we can better make the thousands of choices that might ultimately lead to our own great work.ââWe're all different, and we are all imperfect, and the imperfections are what makes each of us and our work interesting.ââDistraction is not procrastination. Procrastination consistently undermines our ability to make things. Distraction is a strategy and service of the work.ââYou are never alone when you're making art. You are in a constant dialogue with what is an what was.ââIf we are aiming to create works that are exceptional, most rules don't apply. Average is nothing to aspire to.ââIf inspiration does not come to lead the way, we show up anyway.â",book
"Wanted to recommend Rick Rubinâs book The Creative Act: A Way of Being to all my artist friends out there looking for some fresh inspiration or even a gift for younger artists just starting out.What has fascinated me about Rick Rubin is how he has had so much success as a record producer, but with such diverse array of iconic musical artists, such as The Beastie Boys, Red Hot Chili Peppers, Johnny Cash, Tom Petty, and the Avett Brothers. All artists I greatly admire for their authenticity. That there must be something very fundamentally sound in his approach and methods.Recently I have been seeing a lot of interesting videos of Rubin talking about creativity on Tik Tok and YouTube and thought âthe book is betterâ might apply here. And it is. It reminds me of a modern-day version of Robert Henriâs The Art Spirit.What I personally wanted to learn more about was Rubinâs involvement with Tom Pettyâs Wildflowers album. Which I view as Tom Pettyâs artistic peak. Considering that Tom Petty started writing songs in 1967 and Wildflowers was made 27 years later, for a late bloomer guy like me, this is very important knowledge to have. : )But Rubin never actually talks specifically about any of the artists he has worked with. He gives a lot of practical advice on how to break out of creative ruts and how to collaborate. Lots of pearls of wisdom on the whole creative process of selecting and nurturing seeds of ideas, crafting them into works of art, and then deciding when it is time to release them into the world, move ahead and start anew.He does however speak about the artistâs muse. He calls it Source. The short version is that Source is a never-ending cycle of metaphysical energy, a river-like current that ebbs and flows very much like the seasons of the earth. Human beings channel this energy into art as it is destined to be created by those ready to receive it. And art is life, because it is a manifestation of the way humans think and feel about life. As long as there is life, there will be art.There is a lot written in this book about self-awareness and being in harmony with the world. Maybe it is Rubin who learned from Petty? That Tom Petty just instinctively knew that he would never run out of ideas or things to create as long as he knew how to tune in to the âSourceâ.Because, and be warned, that there are also lots of phrases like âWe are dealing in a magic realm. Nobody knows why or how it works.â And âThe best work is the work you are excited about.â Which are true, if not obvious, and a bit annoying if not for so many of them. Because they end up sounding like empty platitudes and salesmen-ship.The book is also over 300 pages. And many a blank space at the end of each chapter to perhaps write notes. A cynic would look at the page inflation as a marketing ploy or ego inflation, or maybe even a little of both.Overall, the book is of value to those who create. Itâs well written. Itâs as if a wise person, a trusted sourceâso to speakâis talking directly to you, coaching you up in their gentle, but very specific, manner. I love that.",book
"If youâve read as many of these kinds of books as I have, donât expect anything new. But that is far from a bad thingâ¦If youâre looking for a distilled and potent reminder of what it is to âlive and breathe the creative lifeâ, this book is for you.As a film director, artist, and creative directorâ¦ I typically read heavily dense books on this kind of subject matterâ¦ This is just a breath of fresh air (not unlike David Lynchâs âCatching the Big Fishâ, which I HIGHLY recommend).I read this book front to back in a few lazy days. Itâs an easy read, no doubt. But itâs also an amazingly great reminder of everything the creative mind must retain on a daily basis. After i read through it once, my hopes, desires, and passion were rekindled.Then, if youâre anything like me, every once in a while youâll open it up to any page - at random - and be reminded of a snippet of inspiration and advice that does nothing more (and nothing less) than remind you of the importance of curiosity and connection with the world around you.A must have. At first itâs a simple distillation of what you already feel and know. Then it becomes a friend that keeps you on the road of the creative journey.",book
"There are many books on a single craft but few on all craft. This is one on creativity that any person who would like to explore their creativity can use to get better. Also, people who already consider themselves creators, be it writing, music, painting or any other artform can bask in Rick's wisdom on how to become a master, which he certainly is. This is a very special book that will be around for decades. The audiobook is amazing - I love it some much, I got the book too. Enjoy.",book
"I cannot find the right word to describe as âgemâ is not enough to tell. I don't know Rick nor heard of him before, the book is a referral from a friend. I would say it arrives / comes to my life at the most beautiful time. If you are an artist, you will resonate with it in full and feeling the sense of belonging, to appreciate all the gift inside you, even no one will see or agree with what you see, what you feel. A book an artist will find ecstasy. I love the chapter being short and precise, quick to the point that one will never lose their focus trying to figure out what author is talking by reading many pages for one simple message. Thanks to Rick Rubin decided to release this without alternating any content in the interest of publisher but keep the very original work of his own after 8 years of writing. A must read. Thumbs up art !!!!",book
"I can't say I am a fan of Rubin's personal philosophy. He's an idealist who deals mostly in the emotional approach. While I like the simplicity and straightforwardness of it, I prefer realism and logic. But still, I am impressed by his approach and his method. I also like the non-traditional format of his book. The formatting choices were borderline esoteric, and that's nice to see. Most mainstream publishers, or even mid-level publishers, would have never allowed that book to go to print without heavy editing. But then, who is not going to give Rick Rubin what he wants. I expected faux-guru platitudes for the simple-minded masses. And while some of the book was indeed that, much of it was genuinely insightful.",book
This was exactly what I needed to read. I thought it would be more about technical production stuff but it was more about the essence of art and who you are. Simply beautiful. I'm not the best reader but this book kept me engaged from start to finish.,book
"This book was a wonderful treatise on what it means to be and live as an artist. It is comprised of short chapters, each more a musing than anything certain. As a self-proclaimed artist, many of the ideas proposed were things I had considered before, but they were still refreshing to hear from a living artistic legend like Rick Rubin (co-founder of Def Jam records and winner of eight Grammy awards). As he writes, âartists allow us to see what we are unable to see, but somehow already know.â This is how I felt reading his book!Many of my friends who work traditional jobs, ones with a start time and an end time, sometimes ask me when my weekend is. The thing is, artists donât really take âtime off.â Do we go on vacation? Sure. But we never turn ourselves off from drinking in what life has to offer, for who knows when that next seed of an idea will present itself, one that we must surely plant and nurture. It is the artistâs job to always remain open and ready to receive these seeds.How do we know when a work is finished? Of course, there is no âcorrectâ answer, it is more of a feeling. We work until it is done; sometimes a project requires long grueling hours and sometimes creating is a short and pleasant endeavor. Regardless what medium of art we are crafting in, âthe amount of time we put in and the results we get are rarely in balance. A large movement may materialize all at once; other times a tiny detail may take days. And thereâs no predicting how much of a role either will play in the final outcome.â As someone who has written music for over a decade, I can attest that this is true.One of the hardest aspects of being an artist is feeling successful. What happens when we publish a book, but fail to get anybody to read it? Or film a movie that nobody watches, or produce a song that nobody hears? Luckily, Rubin has an answer for this quandary of the soul as well, reminding us that âsuccess has nothing to do with variables outside yourself.â Once we have finished with our current work, and are ready to release it to the world, we are successful. It is something that âoccurs in the privacy of the soul.âFrom finding ideas, crafting them, editing them, believing in them, releasing them, getting feedback, all the way to starting again, Rubinâs book touches on every aspect of living the creative life. It is full of wisdom that I will surely revisit in times of need.The most important question it asks is: Why make art?The answer: To connect.",book
"This is the age of the 'self-made 'creatives' and one has to constantly deal with issues of self-doubt, ways to attain excellence, maintain a true voice and eventually be able to resonate with an audience. This book has definitely helped me to cope with my inner struggles, and has been authored with the tone, perspective and wisdom that allows it to be a companion to your self. I hope it ends up being on the essential reading list for humankind.",book

"The introduction hooked me; the questions about reading every diet (and nutrition) book, having enough supplements to stock a pharmacy, emotional eating, and so much information, with so much of it conflicting!I read on. And I come to see that Dr. Lyon is pulling all the conflicting information together and laying it out in a logical, scientific and psychological format. These are the nutrients you need to build muscle; muscle building is what you need to be able to live a longer, more active life. Here are the tools to make it happen. Here is how to build your mind and will to be able to overcome all the obstacles you have been facing. Even as I find questions along the way - how in the world do I do that exercise? for example - a few pages later I find a clear description. And all along the way are links (in my kindle edition) to find more tools and connections. I am only on the cusp of getting near the end of this book, but already I have used the information provided to start monitoring my nutrition and I am excited to have some actual doable direction with my exercise (I must admit to being one of those who never seems to get a plan for strength training in place, I just bounce from exercise to exercise).There are no shortcuts here - no magic pills. But if you want to get healthy, here is some sound guidance. And finally, the entire focus of building muscle rather than losing fat as the focus feels so much more positive and possible!",book
"What an excellent collection of knowledge to share. Pills, potions, insane cardio sessions, hours lifting weights, etc â¦â¦ NOT the answer. I read a new book release Dr Mark Hyman wrote about. I was curious so I immediately bought it and when I received it I skimmed through looking for the scientific Evidence Based Practice (EBP) data. I was pleasantly impressed it was all there. A word, or two that one must wrap their arms around âLifestyle routineâ. This is it. No gimmics, but grit is required as one achieves results by what one puts into their own health. I am a 67 female, that needed to hear the only place I need to search for results is looking at me in the mirror and reframe my lifestyle with âmuscle centric medicineâ as the EBP is there, now I adaoyoand adopt these truths. The human body was beautifully and wonderfully created to sustain us; âForever Strongâ by Dr Gabrielle Lyon brings it to all scientific evidence. WOW, life had just gotten better. I can see the picture of health in full view for myself. Thank you for pushing through to bring this book and practice to fruition. Yes, I am a retired RN, charge nurse inpatient hospital setting. This is a wake up call for healthcare professionals too many are too stressed, in need of caring for themselves. Thank you Dr Lyon, thank you.",book
"I have followed Dr. Lyon for several years on various podcasts and on her social media. Her message on protein and strength training resonated with me from the first time I heard it. Now she has written a book that gives everyone easy access to all of this information. I have been recommending it to all of my friends. Her best advice: Stop thinking about losing fat, start thinking of building muscle! Muscle does far more for our bodies than help us get out of bed in the morning. Get stronger. Eat foods that help your muscles and brain. All of this will help you age gracefully whether you are young or already a senior citizen. You can improve your health at any age.",book

"âThe book Forever Strongâ by Dr Gabrielle Lyon is an informative guide to achieving healthy longevity by properly maintaining muscles. In the first part of the book, Dr Lyon, a physician, explains the importance of maintaining muscle for overall health. As we age, we lose a significant amount of muscle without conscious diet and exercise choices. The book's second part describes the recommended diet, which emphasizes protein consumption, and general exercise recommendations to build and maintain muscle. The book's final part offers specific meal plans, recipes, and exercises for readers to follow.Forever Strong is an engaging and informative book that provides valuable data and explanations on how our body functions with strong muscles built through protein-rich diets. I found the research on the intersection of nutrition and marketing particularly interesting. In the book's second half, Dr Lyon uses her research to provide reference materials for meal planning, exercise guides, and lifestyle choices. The book is a valuable resource for those looking to improve their health and fitness.â",book

"Demon Copperhead. Holy moley, what a book. It's one of those books I made myself put down just because I didn't want to finish it too soon. At the same time, it's one I probably wouldn't have read at all, except that a friend recommended it, based on the fact that one of my own writing projects is dealing with some of the same themes. That, plus its connection to David Copperfield and the almost lyrical prose of the free sample chapters, convinced me to pay the exorbitant-for-Kindle price of the whole book.Well, I'm glad I did. Demon Copperhead is one of those books that gets in your head and stays stuck there until you finish and even afterward. Your pages turn a mile a minute because not only do you want the characters to be okay, you want to know what happens. You want to see Demon and his compatriots either triumph over their hardships or, if they choose a path that won't end there, at least get to an ending that makes sense and leaves a logical and lasting impression. Which in both cases, oh boy, do they. These characters don't just feel like real people, they are real. I know I say that a lot, but man! I was not one of them; I was your classic straight-A, straight edge student who went home to stable parents every night. But I knew these kids existed. I lived (still live) in a town with problems and stories similar to Lee County's. I didn't have the same problems or story as Demon, but straight A's and straight edge or not, I had my own reasons for being, let's say, in the ""orphan class"" of my circle. Like Demon, I spent a lot of years feeling like I had a lot of shine, but if it came off, people would see coal underneath and be repulsed.Beyond that, Barbara Kingsolver just plain nailed these characters, these settings, this life story of her modern, Appalachian David Copperfield. I not only felt for, but felt with and not only traveled with, but traveled inside, Demon all the way from his home next door to the Peggott's, to Creaky's farm, to the McCobb's, to Coach Winfield's and everywhere in between. I can't say every place and character was one I grew to love. I mean, come on, some of these people are downright cruel or downright creeps. But, they were three-dimensional and I could at least understand them. And even the situations and scenes at which I cringed, left an impression on me. Special mention goes to:-The Squadron at Creaky Farm. Every kid needs a friend like Tommy, I don't care who or how old you are. And as dysfunctional as the Squadron was, I got behind the brotherhood. I've written situations and characters like that, not as well as Barbara has, I'll grant you. The commitment to survival, the heart, the unbroken spirits, will do something to you.-Demon's developing drawing talent and cartoons. I loved seeing those, from his first superhero drawings all the way up to the Red Neck comic strip. I kept thinking, how would he draw me? And I loved how Barbara gave this resilient, rough-edged character an artistic, soft side without making him a stereotypical beta male or heaven forbid, what folks in Appalachia might think of as a sissy.-Mr. Armstrong and Ms. Annie, of course. Not just because they're ""good teachers trying to save the poor foster kid,"" either, which I've seen done and done poorly. No, you get the sense they're learning and growing right alongside Demon, making their own mistakes and learning how to save up and give away their own juice. Plus, I absolutely loved Mr. Armstrong's way of showing his students their history and how it has contributed to their current poverty, educational lack, drug-related temptations, ""and etc.""-Angus Winfield, oh my gosh, I just love her to bits. She is the coolest and least stereotypical high school student you'd ever want to meet. If we were in high school together, we might've blown each other off, but I'd like to think we could've been friends. Maybe we would've reluctantly partnered for one of those stupid Antarctica projects and laughed over the fact that Bettina Cook thought penguins lived with Santa at the North Pole.Aside from settings and characters, Barbara also nailed her themes. As mentioned, the one that sticks with me the most is the history, present situation, and future outlook for the kids of Appalachia, especially considering the current prescription drug situation. Now again, I was not one of those kids and am not one of those adults. But, having lived with cerebral palsy from birth, having gotten nothing but the runaround and the ""we give up, you're too 'high-functioning'"" from those who should've fallen all over themselves to help--yeah, I got Demon's frustrations, from a different place. It's no picnic when over 90% of your income comes from a government check--and that's *with* four-year college, Aunt June. So yeah, I was with Mr. Armstrong, and Ms. Annie, and Angus. Wake up, stupid school board, napping principal, whoever. Get off your butt and give these kids a future, even if it has to start with one little academic team. Wake up, medical system, one kid's overdosed mom oughta be enough to make you think, what's going on with these prescription drugs? Wake up, social services, what part of filthy farmhouse, slave labor, and flat broke family with four kids under seven don't you *get?*The other themes, especially resilience, jump off the page, too. I rooted for Demon the whole time because, as Mr. Armstrong says, he is the driver. He walked out of the major car wreck, not once, but many times. Sometimes I cringed at his naivete, as with the original David Copperfield, especially when it came to Emmy and particularly Dori (who I felt sorry for, but my Lord)! But pair that resilience with the darker side of the human condition, such as which lives get celebrated and which lives just get the casket lid closed on them, and it shines all the brighter.Several scenes ""popped"" all over the book, so many it would take too much time to enumerate them all. And some I can't tell you about without spoiling the ending, although the ending is that little bit of hope and happiness I hung on for. And you *do* have to hang on, through a lot. One reason I took a star is sheer length. This thing is a doorstop. Now, that's not a problem on its own. Barbara Kingsolver is kinda known for doorstops. But it doesn't work as well here as I've seen her work with it, because what you have with this book is Demon's entire, literal life story. For me personally, there were a few times where I asked myself, ""Do I really need all this?"" And there were times where Demon seemed to relive versions of the same kind of experience. I felt like, ""Okay, I've seen this once and it was powerful enough that I think we can move on.""I also took a star because, as much as I loved all these characters, sometimes they crowded the stage. Sometimes there'd be characters in a scene or an arc who I didn't think needed to be there. I completely understood Barbara's desire to make Lee County one of those places where you keep coming back and you keep running into people you knew and they in turn touch your life again. It happens, I should know. But truth is stranger than fiction, and in fiction, all these people popping in and out just cramps the book's style. Some characters, like Tommy and Fast Forward, it works for. Others it's like, ""Okay, move along.""Perhaps this is why I thought a few threads weren't developed at the pace they should've been. For instance, Fast Forward is a monster and I'm totally behind that. And you do see hints of his true character throughout the novel, like at Creaky Farm. But he's in and out of the story so much that the actual revelation of how deep Fast Forward's problems go--well, it works, but it also feels a bit out of left field. The same is true for Betsy's thread, in that yeah, I buy Demon having a grandma he doesn't meet until he's twelve, and I buy her not wanting to be in his life. But then, as Angus says, her desire to basically take over makes no sense.Finally, yes. I did take off points for language. That's not because I can't ""handle"" it. I'm an adult, for goodness' sakes. But the near-constant F-bombs just got on my nerves after a while because, just, really? And as you might know, the misuse of Jesus' name is a very personal pet peeve. Now, I'm sure Jesus Himself had to tell His disciples to clean up their language now and again, especially Peter. And it's my personal theory that our beloved St. Paul had a potty mouth, at least to a point. But it does wear on you. So, not a major issue for adult readers, but if it's not your thing, caveat emptor. And yeah, I'd say don't give this one to your teen, it's got some pretty heavy depictions of addiction in it, as well as a couple of sex scenes I freely admit I skimmed.All that aside though, I don't regret spending a minute with Demon Copperhead. He is a perfect modern David Copperfield, he got me thinking, and in a weird way, yeah, the book blessed me. It inspired me to keep writing. And I'm willing to bet it will stir something new and unique inside you, too. Mature readers, grab a copy and savor. There's redemption to be had if you're looking.",book
"The similarity of this title to Dickens's _David Copperfield_ is no accident; though the books are very little alike, Kingsolver cheerfully admits that she owes Dickens for inspiration; the theme is much the same: institutionalized poverty, and the terrible effects it has on children in particular.Like his sort-of model, Demon -- his real name is Damon Fields, but almost everyone in this book goes by a nickname of one sort or another -- narrates his own tale, and begins with his birth: in the caul, as he says; the amniotic sac emerged, undamaged, with him in it, while his mother lay unconscious, from the chemicals in her bloodstream, on the floor of her single-wide. That he survived is due to her neighbor and landlady, Mrs. Peggot, who checked up on the mother on her way to church, ahe had her husband call an ambulance. No father's name appeared on Demon's birth certificate; mother knew who the father was, but he had drowned at a place called the Devil's Bathtub.This all takes place, I should say, in Lee County, in the south-western part of Virginia, Appalachian coal country. Demon's mom -- when she isn't on a bender or in rehab -- works at the local Wal-Mart, stocking seasonal items and telling customers where to find things. He himself grows up more or less wild, alongside his friend Maggot, Mrs. Peggot's grandson, who is with her because Maggot's mom is in prison for carving up her abusive boyfriend. Mr and Mrs Peggot do a lot to help Demon out, and they provide a sort of extended family for him.Demon's youth ends abruptly when Murrell ""Stoner"" Stoner arrives, woos the mother, and ultimately moves into the trailer. He is as abusive as Maggot's father, and at one point locks Demon into his room for multiple days. His behavior drives Mom back onto drugs -- she has been collecting chips for a while now. She turns up unconscious, and Demon (who by now has not eaten or been to the bathroom in several days) rides with her in the ambulance. DSS -- the local version of Child Protective Services -- comes along and ""places"" Demon at a farm/foster home run by Crickson, an old widower who works the boys hard tending the cattle and harvesting the tobacco.And, as you might expect, things go downhill from there. Eventually Demon has a brief period of happiness and glory, when, running away from another foster home (run by Mr and Mrs McCobb) he finds his paternal grandmother, Betsy Woodall. She and her chair-bound brother Dick see to it that Demon is placed in with Coach Winfield, who trains him up to play football. He quickly becomes a star in the high school football team, until a knee is very badly broken.This begins Demon's dependence on Oxycontin and other drugs, which, by now, have become a major theme of the book.Let's go no further with summary; let us rather consider the thematics of _Demon Copperhead_.As noted, Kingsolver explicitly states that her primary theme is the effects of institutionalized poverty, especially on children. Demon muses about the poverty trap at some length throughout the book. At one point, a teacher gives a short lecture on the ongoing war of the Haves on the Have-Nots. (My term, not his.) He goes into detail about how the coal company ruined the land economy of Lee County and ate up its men, until machines took over and most of the men were suddenly unemployed.The drug companies, and especially Purdue, named explicitly by June Peggott (another daughter of Mrs. Peggott), a nurse, who gives occasional lectures on how opioids, and especially Oxycontin, have further destroyed the folk of Lee County. One of the more hellish locales in _Demon Copperhead_ is a pain clinic run by a doctor who, for a fee of one sort or another, happily writes whatever prescription the patient asks for.One of Demon's friends, Tommy Waddell, brings in a third variation on the theme: he describes how American culture has made ""hillbillies"" a laughingstock, a living punchline, and a lesser class of human being, from _The Beverly Hillbillies_ and its kin, to _Deliverance_, and beyond. He and Demon (whom, I have not mentioned, is an extremely talented artist) create a comic strip about an Appalachian superhero, the Red Neck, and it runs weekly in the local newspaper (where Tommy, by this point, is working).It is pretty clear that one of the purposes of this book is to provide a counterweight to the ""hillbilly"" image, while staying true to the characters and communities it depicts. Lee County is real; the small towns named in the book are not; nor, of course, are the specific characters.Ursula K. Le Guin wrote that fiction writers tell the truth by lying. _Demon Copperfield_ tells a whole lot of powerful truth. In much the manner of Dickens, Kingsolver makes you care not only about Demon but about much of his supporting cast -- excepting the genuinely villainous ones like Stoner -- while recognizing their flaws.This is, in short, one incredible book.",book
"When, at the age of 15, I first read David Copperfield, Charles Dickensâ classic novel of the protagonistâs struggle to rise above child poverty in a society seemingly structured to keep him poor, it was the first book that made me tear up at the end, that glorious end with the angelic Agnes ever âpointing upward.â I wasnât sure that Barbara Kingsolverâs DemonCopperhead could possibly elicit anything like that response from my jaded, seen-it-all-before, read-it-all-before consciousness. Re-imagining the quintessentially British Dickensâ nineteenth-century story as a twenty-first century slice of American Appalachian life? Howâs that likely to work?Well, of course, it was likely to bomb spectacularly. But instead, what I found from the bookâs very first paragraph was a voice that explodes off the page with both confidence and world-weariness, with stoicism and self-knowledge, with everything the character is going to exhibit in the rest of this blockbuster of a novel.Dickensâ David famously opens with, âWhether I shall turn out to be the hero of my own life, or whether that station will be held by anybody else, these pages must show.â By contrast, Kingsolverâs Copperhead (whose real name is Damon Fields, but he has red hair, soâ¦) opens with, âFirst, I got myself born. A decent crowd was on hand to watch and theyâve always given me that much: the worst of the job was up to me, my mother being letâs just say out of it.âIn this life, you make your own choices, and if youâre going to get anywhere, and your mother is in and out of rehab constantly, you have to do it yourself, Damon tells you at the beginning. You think thereâs going to be a hero in your life? Think again. Thereâs just you, trying to make your way in a world thatâs stacked against you. Hereâs a voice that, in its tone of genuine down-home rural Americanism sounds a lot more like Huck Finn than anybody in Dickens. Like Huck, he has a memorable way of putting things in his colorful American vernacular: Heâs âthe Eagle Scout of trailer trash,â he tells us at one point.And I donât mean to say that you must be familiar with David Copperfield to enjoy Demon Copperhead. You can follow the plot, empathize with the characters and absorb the themes of Kingsolverâs book without ever having heard of Dickens. But it does add something to the overall experience of the book if you know the Copperfield story. In particular, thereâs a bit of fun for readers when they can recognize by name a Kingsolvian character intended to parallel a Dickensian one. Thus, when Damonâs abusive stepfather bears the name of âStoner,â itâs easy to see the connection with Davidâs equally cruel stepfather, whose name happens to be âMurdstone.â Damonâs kind neighbors, the Peggots, clearly recall Davidâs friends the Peggottys and Clara Peggoty, Davidâs early nurse and lifelong friend. Dickensâ charming and narcissistic James Steerforth, who for a while promises to be that âhero of my own lifeâ David looks forward to in his opening sentence, finds his counterpoint in Kingsolverâs Sterling Ford, nicknamed Fast Forward, star quarterback on the high school football team and, for awhile, Damonâs idol. Copperfieldâs âchild wifeâ Dora Spenlowe is echoed in Kingsolverâs Dori, and when Damon falls for his needy, childish Dori you donât have to remember David Copperfield to know that relationship is going to be a disaster, but it helps.Occasionally Kingsolverâs parallel characters are direct mirror images of Dickensâ, as in the case of Damonâs grandmother Betsy and her eccentric friend Mr. Dick, who liked flying kites, mirroring Davidâs great-aunt Betsy and her eccentric friend Mr. Dick who also liked flying kites. Sometimes thereâs more of a difference: Damonâs short-term foster father Mr. McCobb has a few things in common with Davidâs Mr. Micawber, lack of steady employment and perpetual new schemes to get rich among them, but Micawber is a well-meaning screwup, while McCobb is just trying to take advantage of the system. And Dickensâ Uriah Heep is a far more insidious villain than Kingsolverâs assistant coach U-Haul Pyles, whose downfall is far less precipitous than Heepâs in Dickens. And then there is âAngusâ Winfield, daughter of the high school football coach and Damonâs foster-sister during the best and worst years of his life, who clearly parallels Davidâs guardian angel, Agnes Wickfield, and who you know from the first is going to be a major influence in Damonâs life.Of course, knowing Dickens gives you an idea of the role these characters are going to play in the story. But the plot of Demon Copperhead is not therefore predictable, as Kingsolver translates these charactersâ motivations and effects on the protagonist into a completely different milieu of time and place. Ultimately, whatâs important about the influence of Dickens on Kingsolverâs book is not the superficial correspondences of plot or character, but rather their very significant agreement in terms of theme and authorial intent. In an afterword to her novel, Kingsolver writes, âIâm grateful to Charles Dickens for writing David Copperfield, his impassioned critique of institutional poverty and its damaging effects on children in his society. Those problems are still with us. In adapting his novel to my own place and time, working for years with his outrage, inventiveness, and empathy at my elbow, Iâve come to think of him as my genius friend.âIt is precisely those social evils that Kingsolver has directly in her sites in this novel: The institutional poverty of former coal-mining areas of her native Appalachia; the effects of that poverty on children, especially children whose parents have been victims of that poverty and are dead or imprisoned. She attacks the ineptitude and bureaucracy of child welfare services, the abuse of the system of foster care that allows people like Damonâs foster parents to take children solely for the sake of taking the monthly support money, or for gaining slave labor like the tobacco farmer who first fosters Damon. She attacks a justice system that will accept the testimony of an abusive stepfather rather than the word of the abused child.But more than anything else she attacks the opioid crisis. Damon, who has a brief period when it seems he may escape the cesspool of his luckless life through success on the gridiron as a high school football star, has a terrible knee injury for which he is prescribed opioid pain relievers to which he becomes hopelessly addicted, and Kingsolverâs indictment of the doctors, salesmen, druggists, and especially the Sackler-owned Purdue Pharma are is merciless in the novel. It truly seems like there is no way out for Damonâbut as David Copperfield had a talent in writing that finally helped pull him out of poverty, the fact that Damon has a talent for drawingâall he has left after footballâdoes give him a ray of hope. I wonât spoil the end by telling you whether heâs able to use it.Thus Kingsolver is not simply the heir of Dickens in recasting his most personal novel; she is more importantly the spiritual heir of Dickensâ novel of social criticism, something you donât see much of any more. Where is Dickens today? Where are the Zolas? The Sinclair Lewises? The John Steinbecks? Gone. But weâve still got Barbara Kingsolver.",book
This was my first Barbara Kingsolver book and my third Audio. This was by far the best book. The audio was perfect. The Narrator did such a great job you could feel every little thing.This book is about a boy. A boy and his life's ups and downs. Mostly downs but a few ups in there. Set in the Appalachians. In a trailer. Born to a teenage mother. This kid really started out at the bottom of the chain. It holds your attention all the way to the soft sweet ending. What all this child goes through is heartbreaking and very realistic.The author did such a good job of describing the events in this novel. Each thing that happened to Demon Copperhead made you stop and take a long look at life. At how things can happened exactly as told. How in some instances things are just out of our control. Things that some people look down on others for having no idea it could happen to them or one of their loved ones. I think in some of the things I heard in this book happen in all families in some way or the other. It's devastating and so sad to think of but also very realistic. Demon has so many losses in his young life. To say that he made his choices is unrealistic. You would have to take a walk in his shoes to see that maybe.I am so glad I listened to the audio version of this book. The narrator takes you through so much and his use of voices in places makes it feel like more than just a book. He told a story here. A story that everyone should read. Or listen too.I see why this book won the author a pulitzer prize. It's that good. It's that real. It's all that and much more. It's a must read.Five huge stars and deserves more. A tearjerker.,book

"Initially I was hesitant about taking on this 514 page novel in my busy life but I had read so many good reviews, I had to give it a try. I must tell you I was hooked from the start.How Barbara Kingsolver is able to channel the voice of a poor young boy of the south and maintain it throughout is beyond me. It would be a tortuous tale if not for the wit and sarcasm of the main character. I took the journey with Demon Copperhead, cheering him and his friends on. I was so engaged with their individual stories, I couldnât put it this book down. I didnât want it to end. One of the best books of 2023!",book
"I enjoyed this book and couldnât wait to see how it ended. I loved the story as told by Demon Copperhead â Damienâ. I am a nurse and was trained and in my practice throughout the years always had a soft spot for those less fortunate. There wasnât anything I didnât like about the book. There were many characters and Iâd have to keep the Peggot clan straight. Thank you for telling this story about people that are often looked down upon those with more education, money, power and void of empathy. I was hoping for a happy ending after all of Demonâs traumas in life.",book
"This is the most perfect book Iâve ever read. It was oddly relatable, very very sad, hysterically funny (shockingly, this could be the funniest book Iâve read - I mean laughing out loud at the narration), complex and simple simultaneously. Authentic. EPIC. Absolutely brilliant. I canât think of anymore nice words to compliment Kingsolverâs novel, but I promise that there are a million ways to say that this is more than just a great book. I will forever be thinking of all the characters. You kinda get entrenched in their lives. I am jealous of everyone that is given the opportunity to read this book for a first time and go through all the feelings and ups and downs (lots and lots of downs) of Demon and his crew. I like to think Iâm pretty well read, read about two books a week. No book compares to Demon Copperhead, nothing ever will.",book
"I have just finished reading this book for the second time, something I never do, and found this book more compelling than ever, maybe the best book Iâve ever read, The writing is rich beyond words, the message is clear, you want to know each character and would know them if you met them because Barbara Kingsolver loves her characters and you already know them sight unseen. Thank you for a glorious read and an education on a region I only knew by characature and now cannot ignore.",book
"Written in first person, Damon âDemonâ is an old soul at a very young age the book takes you thru a tragic and abusive childhood. Reminiscent of David Copperfield . Winds thru what looks like some saving grace in a new home situation that then devolves into addiction due to injury and finally ends in recovery and full circle. Demons first person is full of southern sayings adding light to a very heavy tale. Kingsolver knows how to write a real story!",book
"Written in 2021 by a secular Israeli actress dubbed the ""Israel Explainer"" by The New York Times, this history of Israel starts in w/archeological evidence of the indigenous Jewish people 3,000 years ago and stops short of October 7, 2023 - complete w/footnotes. It lays out the history of the entire geographic region as well as that of the author's family who fled pogroms in Europe for the safety of a Jewish homeland. It's irreverent and straightforward and allows the reader to quickly grasp the long history of the surrounding region until Israel's official designation as a UN state by 1947. She reiterates that Israel is the sole democracy in the region & is populated by Arabs, Christians, & Jews w/equal rights for women, LGTBQ+, and a thriving economy despite not having ANY natural resources.If you're not into sagas, skip to The Appendix which summarizes 3,000 years in 5 pages of bullet points. There's a glossary of terms that after often misused and misunderstood. I flew through it in a weekend & was wiser for having done so. Kudos to Ms. Tishby.",book
"Over the course of my life I have studied the history of Israel in various ways - reading books, taking courses etc. Given the current war I felt I needed to brush up on my Israel facts in order to intelligently defend the state that i love. This book details all important events with statistics and facts and goes into important details like BDS, the UN, antisemitism and more. It also is told from Noaâs perspective giving you insight to who she is as a person and her familyâs connection to the land. I love Noaâs style and admire her courage to stand up so eloquently for what is indeed the most misunderstood country on earth.",book
"Today itâs in the news and itâs worth finding what happened in the past and getting a handle on whatâs happening and how to look at it And why there is so much anti-Jewish sediment going on now what it means, and how to look at it.",book
"Tishby does a great job of relaying the history of the State of Israel from it's inception through her eyes and those of her family before she was born. This is not a typical book of history . It's written in a very informal way by a woman more attuned to the world of entertainment than history. She made some great points about how Israel has on a few occasions offered to give the West Bank to the Palestinians as their own state but didn't adequately explained why they have continued to expand the Jewish settlements. Overall, a very enlightening book.",book
"Incredible book; a must read in todays world. Thoughtful, personal, fair. Noa is an incredible writer!",book
Great introduction to the history of Israel and the challenges of the region. Highly recommend for anyone wanting to better understand Israel,book
"This is so well written, educational and does a great job citing to facts! Anyone interested in learning about the middle east must read this book",book
Exactly as the title states- this is a simple guide to the most misunderstood country on earth.,book
Well written! Very easy read. History put in a simple to understand way. Loved it! Thank you Noa!,book
"...and you if haven't read it, please do it immediately. A nice, funny, and deeply effective book to understand Israel and Israelis. And a good tool to learn what to believe and what to discard when you read the news during this war.",book
"I seldom read fiction, as I read non-fiction voraciously to prepare for my weekly podcast. As I love octopuses, thanks to seeing the documentary My Octopus Teacher 13 times, someone recommended this book to me. It was an absolute delight! Shelby's writing is enchanting - she delivers the beautiful nuance of language among different dialects of English speakers which just draws you in big time. And the story is deliciously elevating and heart-warming. She shows us the beautifully interconnected world we all live in but seldom take time or effort to glimpse or truly appreciate. I can't wait for her NEXT novel!",book
"I am besotted with the octopus. Besotted! This first-time novelist presents a marvelously erudite creature narrating how much he KNOWS, and I must confess that his knowing(s) really melted my heart -- like my dog does, always devotedly attending and perfectly, albeit without a word. For me, this story amplifies my wonder at how seamlessly non-human nature can communicate with us, offering incredible kinds of conversation â even from inside a tank at a marine-life aquarium.Marcellus the Octopus is always ruminating about what he hears from people passing through the tank exhibits, saying things like âIgnorance is bliss.â To this particular expression, Marcellus objects because, he says, ""Here, in the kingdom of animals, ignorance is dangerous. The poor herring dropped into the tank lacks any awareness of the shark lurking below. Ask the herring whether what he doesnât know can hurt him.â This contemplation becomes compassion when the octopus notes that âHumans can be wounded by their own oblivion, too. They do not see it, but I do. It happens all the time. Humans walk alike (or, in this case, unalike) far more than they realize.âThe human characters in this aquarium couldnât see what Marcellus could â- until they could, thanks largely to assistance from a literal sucker for injured creatures; creatures like himself; creatures captured in the ticking of time with lifespans that are getting shorter every day.Spoiler alert: they all get freed in the end.",book
"This book was so good, the stories about each or the characters, including Marcellus the octopus, are so wonderfully intertwined that you can't stop reading--you can't wait to find out what's next in each of their lives. While the portrayal of the octopus seems beyond what he could possibly see and do, it forced me to do some research about the ability of giant octopi to accomplish some of the things that Marcellus did--yes, there are examples of these creatures accomplishing what he does. (Obviously, no one actually can verify what they think, but these creatures have been observed doing many of the things that he does in the book.) The best part of the way the book is written is that all of the characters are developed well and their lives, while they seem to be totally separate one not truly influencing the others, are slowly intertwined as the book continues.Obviously, I loved the book and found it hard to put down. I called one of my daughters to tell them that I had a wonderful suggestion for her next read. (She is a working mother with 3 kids who keep her busy a lot of the time.) She told me she had one for me also: it turned out that she recommended Remarkably Bright Creatures to me just as I was about to do the same to her. The discussion that my book club had of the book reached the same conclusion--don't miss this book and we wondered what the next book from Ms. Peck would be.",book
"âRemarkably Bright Creaturesâ by Shelby Van Pelt starts with an animal as a main character, and if you have seen âThe Shape of Water,â your first fear is a recreation of that quirky top twist. We alternate chapters between Tova, an aquarium custodian, and an octopus. Because we accept this as a work of fiction, we go along, despite our doubts, about which aquarium dwellers would have the best mind for crime-solving and why Van Pelt chose the eight-legged one.Cameron, a third character, has a bad breakup and loses his job. Now, we have three lives that need to intersect, and it does not take long for you to care about them. Tovaâs misanthropic characteristics somehow make her more intriguing. The incident when all three of these remarkably different characters come together happens early in the novel but still qualifies as an âa-haâ moment. Each is a bright creature in its way, and they will surprise you.An octopus as an omniscient narrator sounds like a hokey idea, but Van Pelt makes it work. As the winner of BookBrowseâs Best Debut, it is unique and not surprisingly like nothing you have read. Van Pelt most likely has a few more stories in her. I read a few reviews that stated how horrible of a human being Cameron is, but that shows you how skilled Van Pelt is. Loveable idiots are hard to produce, so I credit the author. She also creates chapter titles that mean nothing until you read, a tactic that works like the âFrasierâ TV show.Predicting endings or twists is not my skill set, but I saw this coming. It did not take away from my enjoyment since the characters meant so much to me then. How would the average person respond in the face of so much loss? Tova leads the novel as a woman who goes about her business in life because what else can she do? Marcellus, the Giant Pacific Octopus, has the advantage of knowing everything as a literary device in which we see the tragedy behind the characterâs ignorance.It is too early to predict that this will be the best of the year, and I cannot see anything passing up this and âIn Love.â The story arc travels at the right pace, and I did not want to put it down. All three main characters had nothing in common with me, but I still related to them. When everything starts coming together and you see the finish line, you cannot help but feel relief and pity simultaneously. You took this journey with all three of them and hoped for closure.",book
"What an astonishing surprise! When I heard about this book about an octopus, I thought, âreally?â But it is so touching and well written. It makes you laugh and it makes you cry. I am an avid reader, and this will be one of those books that I will never forget. It is book that will stay with me forever. Bravo Shelby!",book
"Remarkably Bright Creatures is such a sweet story. I enjoy books with storylines that seem completely separate that end up coming together in the end very much so of course I loved this one. Having some chapters narrated by the octopus is an added bit of fun plus it makes it so you, the reader, know things before the characters (another thing I enjoy in books). I highly recommend this book to adults who enjoy a feel good story.",book
"I had been putting off reading #RemarkablyBrightCreatures because I was skeptical about a book featuring a giant octopus. I couldn't have been more wrong about the octopus. I was literally ""hooked"" from the first chapter. #Marcellus the octopus narrates several chapters from his tank at the Sowell Bay Aquarium in Washington state. He is intelligent, very clever and full of secrets. His interactions with the late night cleaning woman, Tova, weave a seamless mystery on love, loss and finding hope. Interspersed between chapters told by Marcellus, are a cast of supporting characters that will keep you flipping to the next page. Cameron, Ethan and the Knit-Wits help Tova redefine family and friendship. This first novel by #ShelbyVanPelt is sure to have you longing to read more of her future work.",book
This is a lovely book that gave me a break when I needed it from the stress of real life. Very well put together and well written. Simple in some ways but very clever in other ways.,book
"A delightful book to escape into when the world around us seems to be going nuts. Itâs a story of love, loss, new beginnings and an amazing octopus who figures it all out before the clueless humans do.",book
I Loved this book! The characters were all so thoughtfully developed and sympathetic. I Loved the ending! I will never look at octopi the same way.,book
"I've been a fan of Harry Potter since about the grade school, back when the only books that had been published yet were the first three, when Potter's popularity was still on the rise, when Christian fundamentalists were still catching on to the horrifying idea that a ""witchcraft"" story was gaining popularity with children, and grade-school teachers were similarly catching on to Harry Potter being a pretty effective tool for getting kids to develop a liking for books. Indeed, that was how I discovered them: my English teacher somewhere in the 6th-to-8th-grade portion of schooling (where my Catholic school shifted to a high-school-like classroom and teacher shuffle to prepare students for the routines public school would involve) introduced me and several other students who were showing less interest and enthusiasm in the class to the Harry Potter novels, actually lending us her own copies of the first three books to get us reading. By the time the much thicker fourth volume, Goblet of Fire, came out, I was so in love in the series that its intimidating size was far more appealing to me than intimidating, like a larger bowl of rocky road ice cream might look appealing.In the decade-and-a-half since, I've never let go of my love of Harry Potter, even if I have gone long stretches of time without keeping an active eye on the franchise. The recent revival of widespread Potter interest of the appealing-but-flawed sequel stage play (""Harry Potter and the Cursed Child"") and an arguably-more-interesting-and consistently-engrossing prequel-sidestory-movie (""Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them"") has prompted me to revisit the book series yet again, as well as replace my old worn-down hardcover copies with both the paperback box set and the eBook downloads from Pottermore's e-shop â which are cross-compatible with Kindle accounts and can be transferred over as identical files to the Kindle versions, by the way, even though Amazon doesn't count those files as purchases of the Kindle eBooks, but rather as separate account-exclusive items. Having checked on Audible, this series does not seem to be compatible with Whispersync for Voice no matter where you buy the eBooks as of yet, so audiobook fans who like to read the text while listening may wish to take note of that when deciding whether to buy a physical or eBook versions (this is possibly due to revisions having been made to the text for series consistency in the time since the audiobooks were recorded).In-depth reviews of the individual books are perhaps best saved for each book's individual page on Amazon, so I will give only a broad-stroke review of the stories here â if you are considering buying the series as a complete box set, it's likely you've already read and enjoyed at least the one of the books. But for the uninitiated, Harry Potter is a series that follows a boy, Harry himself, across a seven-year series of adventures culminating in the return and subsequent war against Lord Voldemort, a terrible Dark wizard who wreaked horrors upon the magical and non-magical communities alike until his unexpected and inexplicable destruction when he killed Harry's parents and then attempted to kill Harry while he was still an infant. Harry, growing up with his non-magical (""Muggle"") aunt and uncle, who cruelly neglect and emotionally abuse him, receives a letter of acceptance to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry when he turns eleven, whereupon he discovers that not only is there a burgeoning community of witches and wizards living and hiding in plain sight in a seemingly-ordinary 1990s British society, but that he is famous among the magical community. They call him the ""Boy Who Lived,"" the cause of Voldemort's disappearance and the end of his reign of terror. But as Harry enters the magical world and begins to learn about this new side of his life and the wonders of magic, he gets drawn into a series of perilous events that lead him closer and closer to his eventual destiny with each passing book, gradually revealing more of the truth behind what happened on the night Harry's parents were murdered and what led to it, among other things.Harry Potter is a fantastic series. One might be tempted to think it's overblown or over-rated by its enthusiasts. One would, in fact, be forgiven for taking that impression almost exclusively from the movies; they're enjoyable enough in their own right, but suffer problems of less-than-amazing adaptation and fluctuations in creative vision that make the film series feel somewhat disjointed and less-thoughtful than the books they're based on, and have the added problem of the younger actors and actresses often taking a few films to develop the skills to portray their characters naturally (an occupational hazard of a fantasy epic that relies on child actors, really). The Harry Potter novels, meanwhile, provide an arguably smoother introduction and, subsequently, a more fleshed-out experience in Harry's world, with the earlier, shorter books providing a comfortable and more ""episodic"" early portion that's great for allowing readers to get their feet wet, becoming gradually more involved and complex until the build-up culminates with the fourth and fifth novels, where the story goes all-in on characterization and worldbuilding detail, presuming the writer to be fully invested by that point, and keeping that level of maturity and intensity right up to the ending of the final volume.It would be remiss of me to call this series perfect, don't mistake the five-star rating for that. J.K. Rowling certainly has her weaknesses as a writer, and it could be accurately said that the novels suffer from a bit of a bloating problem that surfaced around Book Five, where Rowling clearly had more power to say ""no"" to her editors (incidentally, this is also the point at which the American text just gives up at hiding away a lot of the Britishisms in narration and dialogue, and I will say the books are at least better for that much). This is a clear Your Mileage May Vary kind of point. I personally enjoy the tangential worldbuilding that comes out of it, and consider it worth whatever ""bloat"" occurs as a result. But then, Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix is my favorite of the seven novels, and even for some avowed fans of Harry Potter, that book was too long and spent a little too much time on certain things. There's really no way to tell whether that will be a problem for you until you get there and either like it or don't like it. But what problems the Potter novels have are, in the grand scheme, just niggles. It all comes together in a really great way and in spite of the flaws, it's a really great series of books worthy of the classification of ""epic.""But one thing that might surprise people unfamiliar with Potter is that this is not a fantasy action-adventure series. It's more of a mystery series coated in a gooey chocolate fantasy syrup. Harry Potter himself tends to fill the role of a combination Frodo Baggins figure and up-and-coming detective character, and the most important plot points are, regardless of who figures out or explains a given part of things, presented as mysteries. Action sequences occur and can be quite intense, particularly in later volumes, but this is not the story of a big, super-cool hero slaying dragons; it's a story of circumstance, figuring out the circumstance, and then reacting to the circumstance. Some readers seem annoyed by the fact that eleven-year-old Harry never matures in this series to a point where by the end of magical high school he's capable of going head-to-head in a duel with a Dark Lord with decades of extensive magical knowledge under his belt, but that is simply not the angle that this series goes for. My comparison of Harry to Frodo Baggins was not an idle-name-drop. Harry's role in this story is very deliberately that of the hero who stands strong against adversity but ultimately triumphs through low-key action behind the scenes of a conflict in which number other, more powerful or more experienced combatants command the bulk of the Dark Lord's attention. And, like Frodo (and his progenitor, Bilbo), sometimes Harry is helped by sheer circumstance, the timely and skillful intervention of one of his friends, or a combination of his own efforts plus those things. The series does give us a fairly clear picture of what an action-centric lead character in this universe might look like, and I think that's where a fair portion of reader disappointment with Harry's more subdued take on heroics comes from, but he is an eleven-year-old who eventually becomes a seventeen-year-old over the course of the story, contending with a villain who has fifty-plus-year lead on experience over him. I think I would have raised an eyebrow had Harry ever bested Voldemort in a straight-up magical fight.As with everything, this series is something you should read for yourself if you're unsure. There's probably a copy available at your local library if you don't live in a particularly strict area with a stick up its rear about fantasy novels with magic in them. I recommend giving them a shot, and if Book One doesn't jive with you at first, sticking with it at least until the end of Book Two. This is a series that improves as it moves forward, each book adding new layers to the existing world by pacing its narrative in the same way a child might learn more and more about the real world as he or she grows into an adult, which is a large part of Harry Potter's effectiveness as a coming-of-age story. The reader, in a figurative sense, grows with Harry, as many of the original readers grew with Harry alongside the release of each subsequent book. This is as much a narrative tool as a consequence of readers aging as they read the books, because with very rare exceptions scattered through the series, the narrative is locked firmly into whatever it is that Harry Potter himself is seeing, hearing, saying, feeling, or thinking, and the reader's understanding of events and the world around him is often limited to what he knows or notices at any given time.As for the separate editions of these books. I can't voice for the ""Complete Collection"" eBook specifically, since I bought the eBooks individually on Pottermore, but assuming the formatting for the Complete Collection is identical, then the digital set relevant to this review is well-put-together and smoothly formatted, just about the best way you'll ever experience Harry Potter digitally without buying the iBooks-and-iOS-exclusive Enhanced Edition eBooks available on Pottermore, which feature animated illustrations and the like. If you have an iPad or iPhone, that is the edition I recommend for digital consumption, but for standard Kindle and Android users, or people who like reading eBooks on PC, this collection and its individual-eBook versions aren't inferior to physical books in any sense other than not having a special font for chapter headings; the U.S. editions of the eBooks even contain the iconic chapter title illustrations, although not the original American cover art (the minimalist cover art of the eBooks makes for a smoother transition between colored screens and black-and-white e-readers, though).The hardcover collection is one that I can't vouch for as a set, but having owned and read through the series in hardcover in the past, what I can vouch for is that the American hardcover editions are very nice to own. The box set for Hardcover may lack the text revision of the eBooks and more recent paperback printings, however, and while the chapter artwork and font for titles is something I prefer over the U.K. editions, it should be acknowledged that the American hardcovers are of a slightly cheaper construction than the U.K. editions, although also, paradoxically, they have a higher page count due to Scholastic's formatting choices (there are fewer words per page compared to the U.K. versions, and Order of the Phoenix has the formatting oddity of being the only book in the series with narrower margins and line-spacing, due to its much higher word count). Having researched this set, it should be acknowledged that the ""trunk"" is made of cardboard, so don't expect, you know, an extremely durable box or anything. It's just a stylized container for a box set.As for the paperback box set, the purchase that prompted this review? It's fantastic. The American version with the characters riding a dragon, specifically: I'm seeing a lot of user pictures in this review second for completely different sets, and it seems there's a motley assortment of mixed sets in the marketplace listings, too. The box itself is quite sturdy and adorned with beautiful artwork by the cover illustrator, Mary GrandPrÃ©, depicting a scene from later in the series that puts me in the mind of the old R.A. Salvatore ""Cleric Quintet"" omnibus cover art (which features a similar scene by what I assume is coincidence). The paperback volumes themselves are of a nice quality that makes them both more durable and less stiff-feeling than some smaller, cheaper mass-market paperbacks, and they even feature raised lettering for the front cover titling, although the paper and print quality are noticeably lesser than the hardcover editions, feeling at a casual touch like the pages would be easier to damage both by bending and by splashing a few drops of a drink in the book's general direction, not up to the quality of some of the better-made paperback novels that I own. Even so, these are paperbacks that should be taken care of and kept for posterity rather than tossed about like a cheapy grocery store throwaway novel that you picked up on a whim during a food-shopping trip, though the thickness of books four through seven may make it difficult to avoid bending the spines.Having checked certain passages in the books, I can also confirm that the paperback boxed set, bought new, should contained the revised editions of the text, as well, for as minor as those changes are to the overall experience (again, they're really just consistency tweaks).",book
"So leading off with I got this on sale for an amazing price.Iâm a little confused why I got the version I did as nothing in the ordering process said thatâs what it would be and it doesnât match the image shown. That being said, I like the covers geared towards children more anyways as the adult ones are boring. I love the version I got. Images others have shared have been different versions. If the version matters to you, order elsewhere, if not then this is a great place to order from. The version is only a cover art matter I believe.Overall, itâs a great series that I will recommend to anyone who loves magic and adventure and tales of friendship",book
"I put off reading the Harry Potter series for so, so long as I thought it would be too juvenile. (I didn't see the movies, either). I love fantasy fiction, but I'm more apt to read the works of Terry Goodkind or Terry Brooks as opposed to books intended for young adults. I am incredibly glad that I gave the Harry Potter series a chance. While the first couple of books are definitely geared towards young adult readers, the world, the characters, and the story that Rowling creates are all so fascinating and fun that it really doesn't matter. I'm currently reading the series a 2nd time and I'm enjoying them even more than I did the 1st time. These books are absolutely timeless classics and are among my all-time favorite books.I've seen all the movies now, after reading the books. The movies were just fine, but the books are so much better. If you've seen the movies and liked them but didn't read the books, you're missing SO much amazing content that truly makes the Wizarding World as magical as it is.The hardcover books make for a wonderful collector's set. I didn't really care about the case they came in, as I prefer to display them on a bookshelf with the rest of my hardcover books.",book
"- Harry Potter and the Philosopherâs StoneI had to research a few Briticisms throughout this book, but they didn't seriously interrupt the story flow. What did interrupt were the numerous comma splices. They forced me to re-read many sentences. Having said that, I enjoyed the plot and character development. I never felt bored.If Amazon had half stars, I'd give Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone 4 1/2. Since that isn't possible, I'll award it a 4.- Harry Potter and the Chamber of SecretsMystery, humorâand a smidgeon of possible romance?The plusses: Rowling steers Harry Potter through a mystery with a surprise outcome, sprinkling the tale with tidbits of humor. When I reached the end, I wanted to keep reading and find out how Harry spent his summer with his horrible relatives.Minuses: Numerous comma splices drew me out of the story, forcing me to re-read sentences.A solid 4.5 out of 5 stars. Iâd award an extra .5 stars if it werenât for the comma splices.- Harry Potter and the Prisoner of AzkabanTwists, turns, and surprises.I enjoyed this most of the first three books in the Harry Potter series. Rowling steers readers through suspenseful mini mysteries throughout the novel. Astute readers might be able to spot clues that will help them see what happens next. Hint: Pay attention to every detail. The old characters make appearances, as well as a few new ones, including an unexpected friend for Harry.As usual, I enjoyed the ending and canât wait to read the next in the series.Rowlingâs comma splices occur far less frequently in this book, which increased my reading enjoyment immensely. I canât resistâfive stars.- Harry Potter and the Goblet of FireThe best yet, with intrigue, laughs, and tears.This book reads like a spy novel. I couldnât decipher the good guys and the bad guys, and just when I decided someone was one or the other, I discovered I was wrong. Rowling finally reveals how to pronounce âHermioneâ (Her-my-oh-nee) due to a clever conversation where Hermione teaches Krum how to say her name properly.Near the end, one of the characters explains how and why many past events occurred. I found it a tad like an infodump. Run-on sentences occur far less in Goblet than in Prisoner, and mostly in dialogue, which assists comprehension.Now, I wonder how Harryâs summer with the Dursleys will go. His summers always intrigue and amuse me.Note to parents: One of the chapters (thirty-two, I believe) contains violent scenes that wouldnât be suitable for young children.Another five-star read.- Harry Potter and the Order of the PhoenixWith every novel in the Harry Potter series, I find myself becoming more engaged and wanting to read âjust one more chapterâ before closing my Kindle.In Phoenix, Harryâs character develops as he grows into a typical angst-ridden teenagerâwith more reason for angst than most of his peers. Rowling increases the romance factor and introduces a character so vile that I disliked her from her first appearance in the novel. A couple of secrets are revealed, including the reason why Harry must spend summers with the Dursleys, and an intriguing clue surfaces that, I suspect, will play an important part in Half-Blood Prince.Rowling provides enough backstory so that first-time Potter readers will understand the story, and the run-on sentences become fewer with each novel.Five stars.- Harry Potter and the Half-Blood PrinceMy optimism about a clue that was revealed in Order of the Phoenix didnât prove correct. *sigh*In Half-Blood Prince, Dumbledoreâs Pensieve acts as a marvelous link to backstory that doesnât seem like backstory. More information about Voldemort appears via Harryâs regular meetings with Dumbledore. We are kept guessing throughout most of the novel, and perhaps will be wrong, about Snapeâs true intentions.Although Rowling doesnât kill people off with the alacrity of George R. R. Martin, she does dispense with another beloved character. The funeral chapter is well-written, evincing tears and a chuckle or two.I wonder whether Harry will carry through with his plans. Is he really who he, and everyone else, thinks he is, or â¦?Now I canât wait to tackle Deathly Hallows.Five stars.- Harry Potter and the Deathly HallowsI withdraw my comment about Rowlingâs propensity for killing off characters. However, their demises were necessary in Deathly Hallows; otherwise, the story wouldnât ring true. Rowlingâs masterful manipulation of emotions had me smiling, nay, laughing, in some areasâand tearing up in others.Without providing any spoilers, I wondered throughout why the photo of a key headmaster didnât give Harry any advice. Plot hole? In previous novels as well as this one, misleading clues were dropped. Some were essential; others frustrated me because they didnât amount to anything.Note to first-time readers: Pay careful attention to clues. You might be able to predict a few twists if you do.Five stars.- General CommentsMs. Rowlingâs style did change somewhat as the novels progressed. Annoying run-on sentences appeared less with each novel.Now Iâm suffering Potter withdrawal. Will we ever see stories about the children of key wizards and witches? No, not screenplays written by others, but novels written by the author herself. I would read them!Five stars for this reading experience, Ms. Rowling, and good luck with future writing endeavors.",book

"The Characters & Their Trendy Northern Virginia Town Come To Life In Vivid Detail & Spectacular Dialogue. Fans Of Nicole Snow Will Love The Witty Humor & Writing Style Here. Coffee Lovers Will Delight & Dog Lovers Will Drool In This Darling Story. Donât Forget To Download The Free Bonus Epilogue Via The Link At The Back Of The Book!ABOUT THE KNOCKEMOUT SERIES:This is book one of the Knockemout series. To date, the series includes:1. Things We Never Got Over (Knox Morgan & Naomi Wittâs story)2. Things We Hide from the Light (Nash Morgan & Lina Solavitaâs story)3. Things We Left Behind (Lucian Rollins & Sloane Waltonâs story)Named after a fictional small town in Northern Virginia, the series is full of lively characters, outrageous banter, and lots of steamy chemistry. There are adorable pets and kids that steal your heart. There is also a dose of danger brewing in the background. Geographically, it likely matches up with either real-life Western Loudoun or Clarke County, Virginia. Although the town is vibrant and attracts visitors from nearby Washington, D.C., Knockemout retains its sense of history and a strong feeling of community. It is rumored that the town was named to reflect the way its citizens have long worked out their problems â the good old-fashioned way. They fight it out and move on. The town is like a big extended family, with troublemakers, problem-solvers, and a charitable spirit.IN THIS BOOK:The story opens in August.Naomi Witt, thirty-six, is the quintessential good girl. A natural caretaker, she never wants to be a burden to others and always puts herself last. She hadnât anticipated the last-minute road trip to Virginia that brought her to Knockemout. She was supposed to be on her honeymoon with Warner. She is a planner, so the change in plans put her way out of her comfort zone. She has a five-year plan and relies upon a plethora of lists to keep her life on track. She bought a home on Long Island worthy of raising a family and had worked in HR for Warnerâs familyâs investment firm for five years. Their four years together as a couple and two years planning the perfect wedding had all been for nothing, though. She tried to be everything to Warner, but she lost herself in the process. She realized her mistake at the last minute, and an unexpected phone call gave her the motivation she needed.Faced with a crisis of her own, Naomi nevertheless dropped everything when she received her estranged twin sisterâs call for help. The timing gave her a place to secretly run away to as well as a distraction. Always the people pleaser, Naomi likes to fix problems. Her sister Tina has always been trouble, but Naomi never anticipated what was waiting for her in Virginia. In the year Tina had lived in Knockemout, she had managed to build herself quite a reputation, and as an identical twin, Naomi soon finds herself reaping the results. She doesnât find many friendly faces.Naomi doesnât find her sister, but she does end up as Tinaâs latest victim. After having lived through the worst day of her life, the next day isnât looking much better. Stuck without a phone, car, or credit card, she is dependent upon the kindness of others. Yet nothing could have prepared her for the discovery that Tina had left behind an eleven-year-old daughter â a niece Naomi never knew existed. Doing right by her is never a question. Waylay is tough like her mother, but behind the hard exterior might just be a pre-teen desperate for some normalcy. She is whip-smart but guarded, and Naomi knows that earning Waylayâs trust will be a huge challenge.Naomi is stuck in Knockemout for at least six months while the custodial arrangement works its way through the legal system. Her entire world pivots as her sense of control is challenged. All of her plans for the future are in upheaval, leaving her adrift with uncertainty. As the locals begin to know Naomi as Not Tina, she begins to settle in. However, there is one particular grumpy Viking of a man that drives her crazy and sets her body on fire at the same time. He is rude and infuriating, and his bad-boy vibe is completely the opposite of Warner's. Almost from the time she rode into town, this man has put himself in the middle of her business, but the last thing she needs with Waylay's custody in limbo is trouble.Knox Morgan, forty-three, is his own man. His good looks, beard, and tattoos give him the quintessential bad-boy vibe, so women love him in spite of his prickly personality. He does what he wants, when he wants, and he wouldnât have it any other way. Rules are for people like his brother Nash, Knockemoutâs Chief of Police. They have a long history of fighting, but they always made up, too. That changed about three years ago, and things havenât been the same between them since. It breaks their grandmotherâs heart. She raised the boys after their mother died, and now what's left of their family is in shambles.Knox knows good things never last, so anything more than a casual relationship has never been on the table for him. He doesnât like strings, and he moves on at the first sign of an attachment. He hasnât been with a local girl since high school, to the disappointment of many. When he is in the mood for a good chase, he heads out of town for a night or two of fun and pleasure. The routine has grown tiresome, though, which might explain his irresistible attraction to a certain newcomer. Little Miss Daisies in Her Hair is not his type at all. She is uppity and needy, and her vocabulary is too big. He hates that he wants her so badly, but if he cannot have her, nobody can â his brother Nash in particular.Knox came into money a few years back, but he didnât take it for granted. He has carefully managed his growing portfolio of local businesses, increasing his net worth. He co-owns Whiskey Clipper with his long-time good friend Jeremiah, whose vision has paid off big time. The old barber shop was transformed into a salon that now draws clientele from D.C. A proud barber, people go out of their way to sit in Knoxâs chair. He spends most of his time doing managerial work for his various businesses, though. When his business manager, Sherry Fiasco, hires Naomi behind his back, he realizes that he is in deep trouble. The last thing he needs every day is to see Naomi waitressing at Honky Tonk, his bar.Knox and Naomi have instant chemistry, but things get off to bad start when he confuses her with her delinquent sister. Naomi doesnât appreciate being yelled at, and she is tired of always playing nice. Despite his intimidating presence, she pushes back, catching Knox and everyone around him off guard. Their crazy banter soon becomes entertainment for the locals. Denying their attraction to one another eventually proves to be harder than giving in to temptation. Knox is stubbornly stuck in his ways, and Naomi is just trying to get by. They agree that whatever they have is a temporary tryst, but then things get complicated. Neither is ready for a relationship. Things move quickly in their rocky ride, but they eventually earn their happy ending.Donât forget to download the free bonus epilogue via the link at the back of the book!Book two, Things We Hide from the Light, follows, in which Knoxâs brother Nash gets his happy ending with Lina. They meet here, in book one.Book three, Things We Left Behind, also gets a brief preview here as Lucian and Sloaneâs backstory is hinted at.Wow! Knox and Naomiâs story is a fabulous read. The characters and their trendy Northern Virginia town come to life in vivid detail and spectacular dialogue. Their story really sticks with you, and youâll quickly be reaching for book two so that you can continue to immerse yourself in the Knockemout world. There were eleven laugh-out-loud moments by my count as well as countless witty excerpts scattered throughout. I also came across eight teary scenes. The coupleâs chemistry drips off the page, too.Knox and Naomi are opposites in so many ways. Knox is gruff and intimidating, while Naomi is kind and well-mannered. Knox wears tattoos and doesnât always stay within the law, while Naomi wears sundresses and always follows the rules. Knox pushes people away, whereas people are naturally drawn to Naomi. Despite first appearances, however, they actually do have a lot in common. Knox may keep people at a distance, but he is all about giving back. He loves his town, his employees, his friends, and his family, even if he doesnât know how to express it. His intentions are easily misconstrued since he is generally so unpleasant. Naomiâs selfless personality is more obvious, which makes her a prime target for manipulation. Their shared concern for Waylayâs welfare gives them a distraction from their incessant arguing. It gives them an opening that might not have occurred otherwise because Knoxâs general grouchiness sets the otherwise pleasant Daisy off. He triggers something wild and untamed in her â an attribute she abhors.There are a few issues that merit mention. First, there are some timeline issues. There is some inconsistency and vagueness that occasionally causes confusion. I looked back several times to verify but had to make assumptions of my own. My takeaway is that the story opened about 2.5 weeks prior to the first day of school, which would be early August, and the story runs its course by October. The bonus epilogue gives a quick peek at the couple with their family and friends five years down the road. Second, Knoxâs relationships are supposedly short-lived and casual, but later there are a few statements that make it sound as if he has had a history of actual relationships â implying something more than casual hookups when in fact he always walks away before it gets that far. Third, there is a point at which I couldnât understand why Naomi hadnât moved. She had the funds and it would have been appropriate given developments. Fourth, Linaâs nearly two-decade friendship with Knox post-breakup didnât feel credible to me. I would have expected her to lose interest at some point and stop making the effort. Further, the fact that she never met Nash in almost twenty years of friendship is not at all credible. Nash and Knox have a history of fighting, but it is only the last three years that theyâve not been able to make up. That Lina walks into Knoxâs establishment like it is nothing shows Knox has actually brought his out-of-town girlfriends home, or at the very least, he has hung out with Lina in his hometown. In a town that thrives on gossip, that friendship would have been rumored to be more and it would have gotten back to Nash, without a doubt. He would have made it his business to meet her. Finally, I was surprised at Naomiâs outreach to Tina after so much concern about safety had been voiced. It was used to further the plot, but it made Naomi look thoughtless.Knox and Naomiâs riotous romance will have you in stitches, but donât forget the tissues. Fans of Nicole Snow will love the witty humor and writing style here. Coffee lovers will delight and dog lovers will drool in this darling story. Naomi is a runaway bride who finds herself heated once tattooed Viking Knox starts yelling and telling her what to do. Their enemies-to-lovers one-night-stand transforms into a fake relationship once things get complicated. The story is smartly written. It is a page-turner from the start, although it does slow down a bit in the second half. The plot is fairly simple. Knockemout comes to life in this story. The characters are wonderfully defined, and the coupleâs romantic tension is palpable. There is a large cast of colorful and unique characters. The story is told in first person. The POV alternates between Knox and Naomi. I rate this book 4.5 stars.",book
"Grumpy man who is unable to stop thinking about woman, said womanâs life turning upside down after her twin sister stole her money, car, and then found out she had an eleven year old niece! Talk about a lot going on for Naomi Witt. This story had everything I could possibly want and more from the grumpiness of Knox, Naomi trying to figure out the whirlwind mess that became her life, and somehow in the mist of all the drama, love found a way, and there were some added heartfelt moments as well as funny moments too!Right from the start, Naomi had just come out of a big mess, but just when she thought things couldnât get any worse, her twin sister Tina, stole all of Naomiâs things, and left her to care for her niece, Waylay, who she didnât even know existed. Add into the mix the ever so grumpy and tough Knox, who seemed to not only make Naomi angry, but frustrated both mentally and physically *wink, wink. Knox seemed annoyed yet somehow fascinated by Naomi from the way she carried herself to low key checking out her Facebook to see everything about her, to having some spicy dreams about Naomi that left him wanting her in ways he had never felt before. Not to mention, Knox downright telling Naomi to her face that she wasnât his âtypeâ haha very funny Knox because based off the way he acted towards her throughout the story would seem otherwise. So you could only imagine the tension that occurred between Naomi and Knox was both a pleasure and entertaining to watch unfold.I loved seeing Naomi adapt to the new changes in her life a.k.a. trying to care of Waylay and trying to be the best guardian she could be for her, especially since Tina (Waylayâs mom) never cared for her, and treated her badly. Naomi wasnât the only one who cared for Waylay, but also Knox, Nash, Liza J, and Naomiâs parents, and the whole town of Knockemout. Having those people rally around Waylay and provide her with both love and support was so heartwarming to see. Plus you could tell that Waylay appreciated having that sense of true family around her since she never really had that to begin with. Naomi struggled in the beginning trying to grapple with ways to connect with Waylay, and provide her with all the necessities she could possibly need and want. Thankfully with the residential grumpy man that was Knox, he definitely went above and beyond to help Naomi with Waylay.Through the drama that came with Tina and trying to make sure Waylay was taken care of, Naomi had a lot on her plate, but somehow during all of it, she caught the eye of Knox. What I found so amusing with Knox was that he was aware that he was grumpy and *cough a bit rude to Naomi, but what also made me laugh was that he would sometimes complain about constantly thinking about Naomi or felt kind of annoyed having to pull her out of trouble. In all honesty though, Knox wanted to help out Naomi because he genuinely wanted to be there for her. If anything, Knox wasnât use to the feelings that Naomi brought out in him, and therefore resorted to being his grumpy self and blamed his bodyâs reaction to only wanting Naomi in a purely physical way. Haha joke was on Knox because based off the chemistry he and Naomi had, their connection went beyond just physical. While I will say, the passion between those two was AMAZING (especially reading it!) the spice, the dirty talk, and pure wanting lust between wasâ¦ WHOA! And of course we canât forget how demanding and possessive Knox was over Naomi.In addition, I loved how Knox became sort of Naomiâs unofficial yet official caretaker, provider in a way. Naomi was so use to taking care of everyone from always cleaning up Tinaâs messes to literally doing everything for Ex in her previous relationship, Naomi did it all! Knox saw that Naomi always put others needs before her own, and he wanted to be the one to take care of Naomi. Something in the pit of Knoxâs gut just had this natural instinct of protection over Naomi, wanted to be her âheroâ.This story was absolutely amazing! I loved that with each chapter, I was drawn in more by the characters, the plot, and the overall feeling I got while reading. I couldnât put this book down, and if I wasnât reading it, I was thinking about it constantly! I especially loved the tight knit community that was in Knockemout. How everyone helped one another, came together as a community, and the overall support everyone provided for Naomi and Waylay. This story captured my heart, Naomi and Knox definitely had some bumps in the road, but they ultimately had their âhappy endingâ. Just when I thought the story ended on a beautiful note, the epilogue& bonus epilogue had me weeping tears of joy. Do yourself a favor and read this book.",book

"3.5/5 â­ï¸ Slight Spoilers if you havenât read thisâ¦This was my second time reading TWNGO. The first time I probably would have given 5 stars. The me that read it a second time didnât love it as much. I still loved it but my least fav part of the book was Knox, the MMC. Heâs a toxic jerk. Iâm all for a broody, grumpy lead guy but he was beyond that for me. The third act breakup was fine for me except that he was getting her naked while formulating a plot to break her heart. Cringe. I donât mind third act breakups but him going from one extreme (breaking up with her) to telling her(not asking her)they were getting married wasâ¦ idk I just didnât love it. Iâm not a Knox fan this time around. Sorry.I do like Naomi though. I feel like the coffee part of her personality went a little too far when that was her first word after she almost died buuuut I still mostly liked her. Her storyline with her niece, Waylay, was the best parts of this book, in my opinion. I love Waylay. (Side note: that teacher who messed with Way deserved to be fired, among other things, not retired.)The secondary characters were also great. I love Stef, Lucian, and Sloane. I liked Lina enough that Iâm hoping the second book will win me over! I do still like this book overall. I love Lucy Score. It just hit me a little different than the first time I read it.",book
"The book gave me that sad, nostalgic feeling of ""wow that was a really beautiful book.""1) The book is a beautiful story about overcoming trauma - specifically fears about falling in love. This happens for a lot of books (I'm thinking Ugly Love as another popular romance book). But really this book has realistic trauma situations and there are so many pages that you really see the characters change and unravel from their pain points. So by the end, I really understood the two main characters (there are alternating chapter POVs!). The author explained in the note at the end that some of her friends had some tragedies happen to them while she was writing this book, and that helped her realize this book would be about choosing to love even when you know it could hurt. It's definitely the message and theme of this book so it's super good in that way. This book doubles as a therapy session tbh. In the world of mental health/relationship psychology, I would highly recommend this book. You're basically watching an anxious-avoidant relationship both become more secure (hence the title of the book: Things We Never Got Over)2) This book is too long. I'm really not kidding. The first 20 chapters should have been cut in half like at best. The author said in the author's note she did not know what the book would be about when she wrote it, I kinda see that still. It's just a lot of romance building and when I tell you the second half of the book is SOOO strong with all the conflict and juicy drama, the length of first half was not needed. Like not needed. As someone who reads a lot of scripts for shows/movies, I am a big fan that every word on a page as a writer should be earned, and so much of the beginning was truly boring to the plot. I am impressed by the original readers who kept on going and then gave the book high reviews. I truly just kept on reading because this book was talked about so much that I had to see the hype. In Hindsight, I would have read a summary online for the first half of the book and then skipped to chapter 21 and started reading the book from then on. Still would have been an over 300-page book to read.3) This should be an exciting series! The author interweaves other characters' love lives so there will be more books in the future that let us see these other characters fall in love. I am so excited cause Lucy and Sloane brought the heat that sometimes I was more engaged in their bickering than in Noami and Knox's.4) There's sunshine / grumpy love and then there's like good girl submissive energy / bad boy dominant energy love and this relationship is more the latter. Grumpy guy's usually aren't rude to the actual girl (they are more like thoughtful grumpies...like Adam Carlsen or Luke Danes). This guy at the beginning was just straight rude to the female lead. I was like now what the heck. And home girl had like no backbone to him, for 90% of this book. Like he straight disrespected her many times so I wasn't really into him as a character. I just have a distate for men treating women like garbage but then buying them gifts and so its supposed to be okay? (um no.) until of course then in the end I got more proud of him over time, but to me he's definitely a guy where he's not really my type. (But for those who read the book, I'm probably more of a girl like Sloane.) So yes just a heads up for readers, it's more of the good girl / bad boy chemistry.5) LOTS of relationship psychology and psycho-analyzing. Sometimes I liked it, other times I felt that the author copied and pasted therapy quotes online and put them into the book. As in it was very generic quotes about choosing love over fear. This book is full of a lot of emotionally unintelligent grown adults being told things they should have learned in their 20s. How have both of the leads not worked through their relationship patterns by now or been told them before? These are conversations people usually have in their 20s, but it might just be a generational thing that people are learning how to heal later. But just a heads up that characters are being told advice that seemed very young to hear for their age. They easily could have been in their 20s in terms of their behavior.Overall:Really great book about trauma and choosing love over fear! Way too long of a book, really strong second half, and would highly recommend it if you like good girl/bad boy love tropes or like relationship psychology since there is a lot of relationship psycho-analyzing that the characters do with each other.",book
"I have to say I bought this blindly after watching a review of this book. Wasn't expecting the hot scenes. It was 100 percent an Emotional Rollercoaster for me. I love all the characters in the book. Until I found out this was a trilogy towards the end of the book I ended up the other two.Just a heads up: the other two books are pretty much the same storyline just with different characters. I have to say the 1st and 3rd are my favorite. The second one is blah, eh.",book
I went into this book not knowing anything about it. I wanted something I didn't usually reach for. I was not let down. Oh my gosh. This book really touched my heart. I think I really needed to read this book. The characters are extremely loveable and relatable. I'm jealous of people who don't exist! Haha! It's definitely a book I would read again. I cried a good bit during the last half!,book
"The twin âthingâ was fun. One do gooder; one crazy criminal! And the niece just added to the fun! For a large part of the story you donât see anything working out for âDaisyâ - she is just too nice. However, keeping Waylay safe and in her custody makes her do all kinds of things she never thought she was capable of. Canât wait to read more of her story.",book
"I have never been much of a romantic reader, i love fantasy, but i care more about action and the plot than the mingling of characters. At least thatâs what i thought before reading this book by Lucy Score. I was pleasantly surprised by this book because the love in question wasnât just between two characters, but a new city, friends,family, and a new version of Naomi that wasnât expected from the beginning. Basically, if youâre thinking about reading this book, do it.",book
"deciding to reread this one was super fun! on my first read, i didn't really know what to expect - it was already a bookstagram and booktok favorite, but i didn't know the plot specifics. my first read left me pleasantly surprised - i really loved naomi, and her relationship with knox. i also loved all of the supporting characters, and felt like lucy score did a really great job fleshing out each character so they felt unique and distinct from one another.none of those feelings really changed this time around, it was just very comforting to be reacquainted with characters that i already knew that i loved! i think i appreciated naomi's relationship with waylay even more in my reread - just the way that they kept showing up for one another and wanting to be the best version of themselves for the other person was really amazing.i do think there were slightly cringey (at least to me) lines in the first 80 or so pages, but that's definitely something i can get over!can't wait to get to know nash and lina even more in things we hide from the light!",book

"4.5 starsAmazon delivered my copy early, so I'm going to do a spoiler free review and then a spoilery one. Pardon if this winds up sounding like an English paper. I have thought so much on the morals and questions in this book that I feel like I should have read this in school.Note: I'm writing this review with the express belief that you, reader, have at least read the book description. Otherwise why are you reading this review?I want to start this off by saying two things. One, this is not a hero story. Snow is never once, in my opinion, shown to be a hero in this in what we modern folks would call a hero. He's no Luke Skywalker or redeemed villain. This isn't some sob backstory to explain ""why the bad guy is bad."" This is yet another set of layers to the onion that is Snow.Second, this book is dark. It's been a minute since I read the original trilogy, but I swear it wasn't quite as graphic as this book was. Cannibalism is mentioned, and it's shown/talked about that someone sawed the leg off a dead woman and ran off with it. One character is killed then hung on a hook and paraded. Another is also gruesomely displayed after their death. Several characters are dragged through processions to ""prove a point,"" another character is hung from two large poles and left to basically die in the sun. Multiple accounts of vomiting/poison throughout, and a general unpleasantness at the lack of regard for human life.Non-spoilery review:This book makes you think. A lot. It makes you question things, and wonder if maybe Snow is right (he's not), but it's written in such a way that he's not a villain. Donald Sutherland in an interview made a great point in saying that Snow isn't a villain, he's just a ruthless man doing what he thinks is right to keep his home and country in one piece.""He does it so well. And he doesn't think he's a bad person. He thinks it's the only way society can survive. And whether you think he's right or wrong, he doesn't think he's bad. He likes himself.""This should be the mantra for this book. Snow is a conflicting, flawed human. In our society, he's evil, a sociopath or a psychopath. He's a murderer and a killer. He's a bad guy. In his world, he's one of the masses. He simply lives as he's been raised to, with a mentality that has been ingrained in him since the war between the Districts and the Capitol. He's simply more ruthless then most and has the guts to make what he considers the ""hard decisions.""Regardless of the other characters in this, they're all props to his story--which fits well with the Snow we know from The Hunger Games. Everyone is second stage to Snow and his life. This is his evolution from being a child to a man, to becoming the Snow we know and love/hate.I definitely don't think this book is for everyone. I'm sitting here with my mom breathing down my neck because she can't wait to read it, and I don't think she'll like it at all, and she's a diehard THG trilogy fan. Why? Because not everyone likes to read depressing books. There's no redemption in this. There's no saving someone from themselves. This is the fall, stumble, plummet into being a not great person and embracing it fully.So take that as you will. Full spoilers below about everything.P.s. This is a standalone.SPOILERS BELOWOkay, so, I was worried about this book when I read the first chapter sample and it got announced that Snow would be training the District 12 girl. I thought, oh crap, it's gonna be a cliche YA. It's gonna have a stupid romance that undercuts the whole plot and makes him a sap. And yeah, it did that, and up until the last 50 pages I was teetering on a 3-3.5 stars. And then oh boy, the end.Lucy Grey was a sweet girl, but she felt off since the beginning. I still can't fully put my finger on it, but her and Snow's relationship felt so <i>wrong</i> the entirety of the book. The red flags went up repeatedly every time he made comments about how she was his, and even so far as to say she was his property, and that's all kinds of wrong. And even though their romance was cute and fluffy, it felt bad, tainted. You knew something was going to happen. It always does in these villain backstories. Usually the whole reason the villain is bad is because the love interest gets brutally killed and then they're like whelp, guess I'll just be evil.Not in this book.Snow constantly struggles with morality and right and wrong throughout this. Should he turn in his friend to the Capitol because they're colluding with rebels and could tear down the (flawed) infrastructure? Or should he turn a blind eye and let his friend do his own thing? Is the Hunger Games wrong or good? Is it wrong to view the District people as second class humans? And so on. This book broaches the topic of racism in very broad terms with the whole District/Capitol thing. You've always known there was a divide between them, but in this, you really see how much the Capitol looks down on the Districts, and you can easily see how that morphs into such a hatred and distaste by the time Katniss first enters the Hunger Games.But I digress. Snow struggles with morality, but he's flawed and very, very imperfect. He rationalizes every death he takes as self-defense or some other reason when really he's just murdered someone because it's inconvenient for him. He kills (or at least removes her from the picture; it's ambiguous) Lucy Grey in the end because she's a loose end and too free. He does it. Not someone else, not some freak accident. He chooses to do it and, by the time it happens, you already know what direction he's headed in so it's not quite another nail in the coffin. It fully feels like him tying up loose ends so he can go do whatever he wants.All the nods to THG characters and names was cool. You also had a lot of The Great Gatsby vibes in the Old Money versus New Money mentality that a lot of the Capitol had with District people who gained a fortune and bought their way into the Capitol life. They're looked down upon by the old families and viewed as trash.You saw a lot of the evolution in the Hunger Games, and you can see how it begins to change and grow into what Katniss and Peeta suffered through. You see how it begins to change from a simple punishment to a sport and a holiday, with the growing encouragement that it should be a normal and good thing.You also see a side of the Capitol you most definitely did not see in the trilogy--suffering. A lot of the book shows Snow struggling with having been a small child living through the Dark Days and the war. He was 8 when the Capitol won, and even then it was hard. You learn about the hell the Capitol lived through as they were besieged by the Districts' army and forced to ration, starvation, and cannibalism. It's a hard picture, and it's so blatantly told. Collins didn't hold back any punches in this. I never felt like what was done was for shock and awe for the reader, but it was definitely that for the story, and it made sense. Regardless of the Capitol not being at war with the Districts anymore, the tensions were still so high that it makes sense for the Capitol to overreact in their retaliation of events. So when one mentor gets killed by her tribute, they shoot the tribute and parade her body around on a hook at the mentor's funeral. It's disgusting, debasing, and shows how much the Capitol views the Districts as nothing more than rodents or livestock.Anyway, I'll stop talking. Go read it yourself. It's a hard read, a heavy read, but it was very, very enjoyable.",book
"The Ballad of Songbirds and SnakesAs most readers already know, this prequel explores Coriolanus's life when he was a teenager. The opening chapters reveal that he was also chosen to be a mentor for Lucy Gray who was from the despised district 12.But what she lacks in fighting skills she makes up for being a charismatic performer. Lucy Gray learned how to work a situation to her advantage.In the beginning the tributes did not enjoy Capitol luxuries but were kept in cages and barely fed. Itâs a stark contrast to the future hunger games when tributes were met with an extravagant welcome and dined on rich foods.The problem was that watching too much brutality turned the Capitol away from the Games. Snow's addition to the Hunger Games of costumes, interviews, and the underdog tributes made the propaganda go down easy. This should be a cautionary tale.A lot of readers are not getting the point the author is trying to make. In the opening of this book there's a quote by Hobbes:âHereby it is manifest, that during the time men live without a common Power to keep them all in awe, they are in that condition which is called Warre; and such a warre, as is of every man, against every man.â â Thomas Hobbes, Leviathan, 1651Coriolanus's first ""lesson"" to be molded into the future oppressor was during the Hunger Games; when he was forced to go in the arena to get out Sejanus, one of the mentors, who was not supposed to be in there. While at the hospital getting stitches, the head gamekeeper, Dr. Gaul, asked if Coriolanus understood what he was supposed to learn.âWithout the threat of death, it wouldnât have been much of a lesson,â said Dr. Gaul. âWhat happened in the arena? Thatâs humanity undressed. The tributes. And you, too. How quickly civilization disappears. All your fine manners, education, family background, everything you pride yourself on, stripped away in the blink of an eye, revealing everything you actually are. A boy with a club who beats another boy to death. Thatâs mankind in its natural state.ââI think I wouldnât have beaten anyone to death if you hadnât stuck me in that arena!â he retorted.âYou can blame it on the circumstances, the environment, but you made the choices you made, no one else. Itâs a lot to take in all at once, but itâs essential that you make an effort to answer that question. Who are human beings? Because who we are determines the type of governing we need. Later on, I hope you can reflect and be honest with yourself about what you learned tonight.âA very similar thought process was also stated by the Joker in The Dark Night:âTo them, youâre just a freak, like me! They need you right now, but when they donât, theyâll cast you out, like a leper! You see, their morals, their code, itâs a bad joke. Dropped at the first sign of trouble. Theyâre only as good as the world allows them to be. Iâll show you. When the chips are down, theseâ¦ these civilized people, theyâll eat each other. See, Iâm not a monster. Iâm just ahead of the curve.âBoth the Joker and Dr. Gaul has distorted thinking. It's one thing to make a choice freely and it's quite another thing to be forced into one.Human nature is such that coercive enforcement of rules is indispensable to protect the rights of all but there is a fine line between government rule and government oppression.Later, as Coriolanus's feelings toward Lucy Gray grew, he helped her to survive the games only to get caught and was sent to train with the peacekeepers in her district. Sejanus joined him there soon after.Sejanus was never one who was comfortable with the Capital and its way of life. He got a plan to help the districts by providing the rebels with guns for their flight up north, out of Panem.Coriolanus found out about Sejanusâ plot. Mayfair threatens to tell her father [the Mayor] everything, which would implicate Coriolanus and Lucy Gray despite them being only bystanders; he shot her.Sejanus is charged with treason and hanged. And Lucy Gray Baird is the main suspect in Billy Taupe [her ex rebel boyfriend] and Mayfairâs deaths, as he left her for the mayorâs daughter.In desperation, Lucy Gray decides to join the rebels up north and Coriolanus decides to go with her, thinking there's nothing left of his life once the murder weapons were found.But as they prepare to flee district 12, Snow gets paranoid that Lucy Gray is betraying him. When they stop at a house near district 12âs lake, he discovers the rebelsâ store of the weapons. When Lucy Gray takes a long time to cut up some katniss plants, he convinces himself that she has abandoned him and went to turn him in.""What if they interrogated or even tortured her? The story would come out. She hadn't killed anyone. He had. His word against hers"".But even though Snow searches for her, Lucy Gray was nowhere to be found.The three killings that Snow did throughout the book contributed to his downward spiral and PTSD. Coriolanus clubbed to death a tribute, Bobbin, in the Hunger Games arena. He also shoots the mayor's daughter and also turns in his best friend, Sejanus, for treason, resulting in his execution.Lucy Gray was the last straw for his sanity. Back at the Capital the reader sees Snow's change to ""the dark side"".""Sometimes he would remember a moment of sweetness and almost wish things had ended differently. But it would never have worked out between them, even if heâd stayed. They were simply too different. And he didnât like love, the way it had made him feel stupid and vulnerable. If he ever married, heâd choose someone incapable of swaying his heart. Someone he hated, even, so they could never manipulate him the way Lucy Gray had. Never make him feel jealous. Or weak. Livia Cardew would be perfect. He imagined the two of them, the president and his first lady, presiding over the Hunger Games a few years from now. Heâd continue the Games, of course, when he ruled Panem. People would call him a tyrant, ironfisted and cruel. But at least he would ensure survival for survivalâs sake, giving them a chance to evolve. What else could humanity hope for? Really, it should thank him.""This happened to Ted Bundy as I believe one of the main reasons he became a serial killer was because his first love dumped him. If you were to get all his victims lined up together you would think they were all sisters and you will notice that they all look like his first girlfriend.Rejection is a powerful force in a person's life if they are not stable. Dr. Gaul planted the seeds for that rejection to take root and grow.",book
"I adored the Hunger Games series. Dystopian YA is not a normal genre for me, but this series is awesome and this prequel? A fantastic villain origin story.Coriolanus Snow is an ambitious 18-year-old student whose wealthy family barely survived the war. He is all about image and pretense, which often vie against his normal, human feelings. His parents are dead and he lives in a rundown apartment with his grandmother and cousin Tigris.But, the 10th Hunger Games is to be the first one with mentors and Coriolanus has been chosen to mentor the female tribute from District 12. While at first humiliated at not being given a more highly rated district, he quickly realizes that Lucy Gray is someone who could win and it's up to him to figure out how to help her do that. Along the way, Coriolanus learns about love and the dangers it can bring.As he works his way through the Games, he also discovers who wields the power in the Capitol, who controls the games and what he needs to do to rise up above the masses.The student mentors also have a say in how the games are run, and in a somewhat twisted sort of way, their professor gives assignments and in Coriolanus' essays, we see how future Games come about and evolve. As the mentors talk about the games and what is happening, we also see how they are not all unfeeling or unkind. They view their tributes as people and they can see how unfair the Games really are. At the same time we see that those in the Capitol are only concerned about their well being and that their losses are because of the rebels.The Hunger Games series is vibrant and colorful in its imagery. This book, however, was almost more black and gray in its imagery, what with the rubble of the arena and the Capitol still trying to rebuild from the war. That made the contrast of Lucy Gray's colorful skirt and the snakes all the more striking.As with the rest of the series, we see the government oppression, we see the results of war and rebellion. We see society broken, but fighting and we see that even with survival, life isn't grand and colorful. But we also see that the human spirit is strong.No one likes who President Snow becomes and I think writing about his story so that he gains the reader's sympathy is brilliant. The story isn't fast-paced, but it drew me in and kept me enthralled.",book
"As a YA Dystopian author, I wanted to learn from the best so I purchased this book on my birthday, just a day after I published my own dystopian book.The Hunger Games series sparked my passion for writing, so this book holds a special place in my heart. But I knew I had to let go of that bias because this is an entirely new thing. I need to read this not as a reader, but as an author. So I approached this book with a careful eye, just like any other character who approaches a jabberjay in the series.The perspective of The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes isn't new to me simply because it's from the villain's voice. It's ""new"" in a way as it explores the coming of age tale of Coriolanus Snow's cleverly paranoid overthinking mind.I knew what will happen to Coriolanus Snow, so I gripped my seat as I approved 80% in my Kindle Oasis. It was simply impossible. I don't see anything bad from happening. I asked myself, ""How will Suzanne Collins end this?""And she did.And I couldn't believe it.It was so captivating that I couldn't put it down. I will not put any spoilers here, but I just want to say... Inevitable as the sunrise, betrayals leave behind a trail of destruction for the snake. Snow will always fall.",book
"I have such mixed emotions after finishing this book, but first of all - this book is absolutely incredible. I honestly think it might be my favorite book of the HG series (!) and Ms. Collins absolutely does not disappoint with her writing and content. Getting to read about Panem, and thus the beginning of the HG was so gratifying and the way this story flowed into, and matched up with, the trilogy was absolutely flawless. Truly, it is excellent!Now - it's kind of rare to read a book when the protagonist is the villain. We all clearly know from the HG trilogy that President Snow is a pretty terrible person, yet reading this book, from his point of view, it's easy to forget that; but it's also fascinating to see how he thinks of himself and sees his own actions. Along that same thought - Snow is very charismatic and definitely knows how to work the people around him to get what he wants or to present himself in a way that will clearly benefit himself, often at the cost of someone else.~~Minor spoiler ~~The other part of Snow's life that I do find incredibly sad - while he definitely has poor character traits to begin with, he was also very manipulated by several people around him, which I think added *considerably* to how he turned out as an adult and VERY much shaped his viewpoint, and his creation of the games.So definitely worth the read (and re-read). This book is very thought-provoking, even from outside the dystopian viewpoint. There are a lot of reflections on who WE are - as humans; as groups & societies; on the roles of government and the rights of its citizens.For the many pages, it reads quickly! Hope you enjoy it as much as I did.",book
OK I was skeptical on getting this book. But I have to say after reading it I absolutely love it. I always wanted to know about Snow and how he came to be the way he was in the books. This book explains it all. I am one of those that read the hunger games at least once a year. Iâm telling you right now this is going to be in the lineup. Itâll probably be the first book that I read. I love learning about his cousin and then remembering that she ended up in the hunger games as well. The names of the kids that went to school with him. iâm just saying it is a good read. It is one of those that you donât want to put it down. Enjoy the book have fun. And may the odds be ever in your favor,book
"I was skeptical about this book keeping my interest. It is a prequel, which *usually* at least gives a few kernels that make ""the original trilogy"" a deeper experience.I was wrong. Like, really wrong. Collins always delivers and this book is a testament to her talent. There are more than a few kernels to be mined here. The title itself is quite clever, as this is Lucy Gray's story, too.I can't say more, nor list any topic specifically without spoilers. I can say we watch the evolution of a Capitol-born citizen trying for a better life to the man who would become president of Panem.-ncv",book
"""The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes"" by Suzanne Collins is a captivating and original addition to the Hunger Games series. This prequel takes readers on a journey to understand the origins of the Hunger Games and explores the complex character of Coriolanus Snow, who later becomes President Snow, giving him a lot more nuance than previously afforded. The story delves into the darker and more morally complex aspects of the Hunger Games world, offering a fresh perspective on the events that led to the dystopian society depicted in the original trilogy. While it may not have the same level of action and intensity as the earlier books, it compensates with its rich character development and thought-provoking themes and the lack of 'action' makes sense given the setting and novelty of the Hunger Games at that point. This novel is a must-read for fans of the Hunger Games series, as it adds depth and complexity to a world we thought we knew so well, making it an enthralling and thought-provoking experience from start to finish. Though the open-ending was a little confusing to me.",book
"If you loved the Hunger Games, you have to read this. I couldn't put it down. I loved everything about it; the characters, the storyline, and the storytelling. This book was a great addition to the Hunger Games series. I am now going to re-read the other books. This book offered insight and background for the books. I can't wait to see the movie. I am so excited!!!",book
Amazing! Another great story in the Hunger Games saga. An interesting look at how Snow progressed from scared boy into what he eventually became as President of Panem. Loved all the tie ins to the original story line and how their origin could have influenced his hatred of Katnis in the original series. Nicely written. Hoping for more in the future!!,book
"These were some of the best books Iâve read in a long time. Sarah left nothing undone when it came to describing a world that doesnât exist. Her story was original in many ways and in others you could see how it was similar to many others of its genre. Her characters were so engaging. You could feel there happiness, their pain, their conflict. I would recommend these books to everyone who loves fantasy. Oh and the fight scenes although not throughly detailed was enough to draw you in and make you feel as though you were in the battle with them.I know there are two other books. Number 4 is a very long epilogue so if you want to check up on Feyre and Rhys family, thatâd be the book. Book 5 is Nestaâs book. I have not read that book and will be putting it off for awhile because in all honesty she was one of the only characters in the book I really did not like. Having said that Iâm sure book 5 is supposed to be somewhat of a book redeeming her but Iâm a little upset that she gets a book and Lucien doesnât or Azriel for that matter.They were the only two characters that had the saddest back ground and deserved a HEA, not Nesta she was a grade a b****. Mor could be seen as another character that had a tragic back story and in need of an HEA, but I donât agree. I hate how she strings Azriel along because she is a selfish coward, just like Nesta, but not so much of a heartless B.If Sarah does come out with books for these worthy males I hope she chooses a different female for them than Elaine. Lucien deserves someone who will love him the way Feyre loves Rhys. And Elaine needs a male whoâll love her the way Rhys loves Feyre. I cannot see Elaine and Lucien having that same connection as the two I mentioned. and Azriel cannot love sweet Elaine that way either cause he will always be tied in someway to Mor. You canât drop 400+ years of longing and insta fall for someone else, especially if sheâs not his mate, which Mor is. Azriel will always put Mor before Elaine. When Mor comes clean and finally lets Azriel go heâll need time to heal and that would be a good time for someone, not in their circle, to help him through that. One could argue with time and the right setup Elaine and Lucien could make it work and be just as enthralled with each other as our power couple, but Lucien has some soul searching to do. Something Rhys didnât have to do. He was everything Feyre needed.Finally Tamlin. Some would put him in the same category as Nesta and Mor but I donât. Tamlin has a good heart. Feyre broke that heart. Did Tamlin handle things wrong? Yes but he could have been so much more hateful, and wasnât. Instead he came to there aid, saved Feyre, spied for the alliance and even helped bring Rhys back to life, because he absolutely loved Feyre. His book would be an adventure for sure. The female would have to be fierce as well as soft and definitely more mature than Feyre. She matured quite a bit after everything that happened under the mountain but Tamlins and Feyres love was built before that and had she been more mature she wouldnât have fallen for him so easily she would have been more cautious and discerning. My heart broke a little for him. Even if I am team Rhys and Feyre.Just my two cents. Enjoy reading these books!!",book
"I loved every moment in this book. I was worried that after A Court of Mist and Fury that the rest of the series would not hold up. While ACOMAF is my favorite so far AOWAR definitely held it own.I love all the new characters that we got to meet in this book along with all the new relationships.I love the connection between all the high lords. We get to see a lot more of their history and the relationships that they all had prior to the current timeline.Many secrets were reveled in this book... or more so truths that have not yet been told.Mor and her secret that now only Feyre knows. I love this direction for her but I also am sadden for the relationship I was hoping for, for her and Azriel. I hope that in the future books we get to see more of their friendship. I hope they will both have new love interest in the future books.Herion and Lucian... Father and son. I Hope this is something that gets brought up again in the net book.The relationships that still have so much questioning and I cannot wait to see what happens.Obviously my favorite is Feyre and Rhys. Enough said.Cassian and Nesta. Are they mates? Not mate? WHAT? I need more. I need to know! There is something more there and I cannot wait to read more to find out.Amern and Varian. I just need more of these two. I love the little bits that we got in this book.Lucian and Elain. We know they are mates. Elain is still in love with her human ex fiancÃ© Greyson. Ew. I love how gentle and understanding Lucian is and backs away when she needs him too.ALL THE TWIST AT THE END!3 that got me the most!1. Feyre, Nesta and Elain's father. I was in tears! ""He calls himself the Prince of Merchants"" âHe told me he's got three daughters who live here. And that he failed them for many years. But he would not fail them this time."" The ships at the front of the human armada became clear, along with the gold lettering on their sides. ""He named his three personal ships after them,"" Drakon said with a smile. And there, sailing at the front...I beheld the names of those ships.The Feyre.The ElainAnd leading the charge against Hybern, flying over the waves, unyielding and without an ounce of fearâ¦The NestaWith my fatherâ¦our father at the helm.I love this for these three so much. I completely forgot about their father and kind of just wrote him off. Then out of nowhere he has been battling and rallying for his girls. He didnât know they were fae and was right in the middle of everything happening but he knew they were there and need help. I am sad that the King of Hybern killed their father. I would have really like to see more of his thoughts on becoming them becoming fae and what happened to them in his absence.2. Amrenâs betraying/ not betraying Feyre. Let me tell ya I was so mad for a hot minute. I had to put the book down. I could not believe what was happening. I was thinking no way Amren is on the wrong side of this. She has helped and done so much. Then the twist.The Suriel left the message to Feyre for Amren. For Amren to release her true self so that she alone can defeat Hyberns army. The begging from both Feyre and Varian for Amren not to release her true self because she would not remember them. She would not be able to return. But she is able to come back but she now is different.She looked to Varian, a wry smile on her red mouth. âI watched them mostâthe humans who loved. I never understood itâhow it happened. Why it happened.â She paused a step away from the Cauldron. âI think I might have learned with you, though. Perhaps that was a last gift, too.â Varianâs face twisted with anguish. But he made no further move to stop her. She turned to me. And spoke the words into my headâthe spell I must think and feel and do. I nodded. âWhen I am free,â Amren said to us, âdo not run. It will attract my attention.â She lifted a steady hand toward my arm.âI am glad we met, Feyre.â I smiled at her, bowing my head. âMe too, Amren. Me too.â Amren grabbed my wrist. And swung herself into the Cauldron3. Rhys dying. I did not see this coming! I have never had a book where one of my favorite characters dies. Or a main character die. I normally love the smaller characters more. Call me cheesy but I love, love. When he died and once Feyre noticed what had happened, my gut wrenched.Rhys was sprawled on the rocky ground, wings draped behind him. He looked like he was sleeping. But as I breathed inâ it wasnât there. That thing that rose and fell with each breath. That echoed each heartbeat. The mating bond. It wasnât there. It was gone. Because his own chest â¦ it was not moving. And Rhys was dead.The after math of this was just a much heart wrenching, maybe even worse. Feyre begging everyone to help Rhys and just when you think no one can help him. Feyre asks the high lords to bring him back like they did her. They need them all to do it, even Tamlin. Feyre says she would",book
"o This is the climax of the series as far as I am concerned. This book gets a lot of hate, but it is honestly, my favorite book of the series.o OVERVIEW: SPOILERS: I have NEVER in my life had so many feelings about a man in my real life let alone in a book. I lost count how many times I closed this book and just shook the crap out of it because Tamlin made me so mad. GOOD LORD MAN. This dang book had me so in my feelings about everything every single time I turned the page.o This is the climax of the Night Court story itself, the war with Hybern and trying to save the Fae Lands and the Courts. Hybern makes a deal with Tamlin and they bring the Night Court to his court and drag in Feyreâs human sisters, forcing them into the Cauldron to become made. But what they donât know is that Nesta, ever the fighter, took from the cauldron just as it was taking from her and her sister. Which was when the Human Queens (part of the treaty) see that Hybern promised immortality from the cauldron with the sisters as tests, run but something was taken from Cauldron so it takes from the next one in the Cauldron, therefore making the Queens mad. War comes, Nesta saves Cassian twice, Hybern kills the girlsâ father and Elain stabs him but Nesta has the killshot and removes his head, the girlsâ father shows up with an armada when Drakon and Myriam show up with boats named after the girls, the cauldron calls Elain and they search for her. Feyre and Amren and Varian find the Cauldron but Amren deceives Feyre and dives into the Cauldron, she becomes her true form and wipes out mostly everything in the war with fire. The Cauldron explodes into three pieces and Rhys and Feyre save it by mending it back together because Feyre remembers that all life comes from the Cauldron, but when she comes back to reality, Rhys is lying on the ground and not breathing. She begs the high lords to fix him like they did her, so they do and he comes back.o Along the way, Feyre faces fears that the Bone Carver told her about to free him to get him to fight with them against Hybern, also faces Bryaxis (the dark thing in the lowest level of the library where the Priestesses work at the House of Wind). Rhys frees the Weaver of the Wood (Bone Carvers sister) to help as well. Hybern kills the Bone Carver and the Weaver of the Wood and Bryaxis is still missing at the end of the book.o There is just so freaking much that happens in this book and that is why it is my favorite. The weaving of stories is immaculate within this book. I know that quite a few people donât like Sarah J. Massâ writing but I did for sure. Iâm also new to the Fae writing, etc. However, I did definitely like this one the best out of all of them and I would re-read it 2942359798 times if I could. The ending and beginning of stories throughout this is just one that I wish I could read for the first time again.",book
"Oh goodness. I will try my best to make this spoiler-free because SO MUCH happens!Now, this book came to me on its release day (thank you, Amazon). I started reading it almost immediately and then I had exams. This is why it took me so long to finish it. I would try to read it before work or before class, but I wouldnât be fast enough.So, we know what happened in the second book. Feyre went back to Tamlin, but surprise! Itâs just a little trick. She will find her way back to Rhysand.Duh, she does. Thatâs not really a spoiler.War is looming and she, as the High Lady, must work with the Night Court and her mate, Rhysand, in order to win this war and bring peace to all. Literally.So, I want to write this review differently. We love these characters so much, so I am going to break it down by character. No spoilers will be revealed for the characters. I will be careful.New characters are introduced in this book, but I will be letting you know about the familiar characters.- Feyre -So, the ending of the second book had us shook. For real. In the third book, Feyre is truly a badass. She is not taking any of Tamlinâs shit, let me tell you that. She is determined to find her way back to Rhysand and, yes she does, as noted above. When they reunite, of course there is the love-making. They wouldnât be mates if they didnât get it on, you know? Anyway...itâs a bit of an emotional reunion for Feyre, seeing her friends and such. Especially her sisters. We get a glimpse of them almost immediately, but Iâll talk about them lately. Throughout the book, Feyre is now a High Lady of the Night Court. She slowly learns how to control a room and she learns more about herself. This book really shows us how strong Feyre really is.- Rhysand -Right now, Rhysand is probably going through hell because he isnât with Feyre and he isnât sure when she will be back. It gets kind of worse when Feyre tries to get back to him. During that journey, their bond is silent. When they reunite, you get that giddy feeling reading their interactions again and Iâm actually glad their separation doesnât really last long. This is only if you ship them, though. In this book, I definitely got a sense of a struggle with Rhysand. Itâs almost as if the ending of the second book and its events really made him vulnerable and he is definitely scared of losing Feyre and we learn more about his time with Amarantha when he was her icky love slave or whatever. We learn more things, too. I like this side of him, this vulnerable side. There are moments during the impending war where he expresses his fear of losing his family. Iâm going to say that there is a moment with Rhysand where you stare at the book and you want to burst into tears. Thatâs all. No spoilers.- Lucien -Everybody wants Lucien. They wanted more of Lucien. Iâm going to say, in my own opinion, that I was kind of disappointed in Lucienâs part of the story. I feel like there was not enough of him. He seemed to be absent, physically, for over half of the book. Before its release, I saw that people were excited to read more of Lucien and his POV. But, I was disappointed that it was lacking. I think his story isnât over yet, though. There didnât seem to be any closure for him. Hopefully, since this world continues, we will get more.- Nesta -Oh, Nesta. I think she is a love/hate character. We get more of her in this book and she becomes more likable, though still frustrating. Letâs just say the situation between her and Cassian drags and it just makes you roll your eyes. Not at Sarah, of course. At Nesta. She is so stubborn and it just annoyed me at times. However, with that aside, she definitely learns to become stronger and to accept herself as a Fae, which I find important. I mean, she doesnât have much of a choice. She still has the attitude in her, but she has her badass moments.- Elain -Oh, man, It was heartbreaking to read about Elain and how she was handling things. I donât know how else to describe it, really. Itâs even worse when Lucien tries to interact with her with hardly any progress. In this book, Elain is stuck on Grayson. I mean, we know that isnât going to happen anymore. But, itâs just sad. Again, with Lucien, I donât think her story is finished. There are some unanswered questions. On a happier note, Elain learns to find her voice and her inner strength after what she went through. That made up for the rest of it.- Cassian -Oh, Cassian. He is still a smartass. But, something is definitely up with him here. Iâm pretty sure itâs because of Nesta and her ignorance of him. He tries to hide the fact it bothers him, but you can tell it really does. We also see Cassianâs bond with Rhysand and how strong it really is; their fear of losing each other in this war. Cassian definitely wants to prove himself in this war and we see that, but some of the scenes were scary. Not sinister or anything. But, as a reader, you are very scared and worried something bad will happen to him. Iâll stop there, for your sake.Iâm combining a few other characters together for one reason:- Amren, Azriel, Mor, Tamlin -Why are these characters combined? Well, letâs start with Amren. We only see Amren when she is helping Nesta and her connection with the Cauldron. There is a scene of betrayal, sort of. But, besides her AMAZING ending, she doesnât feature that much.Azriel is kind of the same. He felt too much like a background character for me and, though there are scenes where you pray for him as you keep reading, I wish he was featured more. I donât think he got much closure either.Which brings me to Mor. Oh man, we have a bombshell with her. I wonât reveal that, though. But, I wlll say her lack of closure goes with Azriel.Tamlin, Tamlin. I hate him, but I kind of donât after reading this book. He spends most of the time just being pissy about what Feyre did, making innuendo jokes to get a rise, and just acting like a fifteen year old. However, there are moments where it seems he wants some kind of redemption or something. I will say that I do think he is still in love with Feyre, but I think his story is at an end. The closure is definitely there and hopefully he will find his own happiness.I want to reiterate that these opinions are my own opinions and how I felt about the book.Regardless of some of the negative opinions, I am still giving this book five stars. This book had me on edge and Iâm glad but sad that this is the last full novel. Unless the book Gods and Sarah want to bless us with another full novel that isnât a novella or something. Iâm still praying.If you havenât read this book because you are scared, donât let that stop you. I was scared the whole way and I kept reading. I am very happy with this book and I loved entering this world again. This will probably be a series that I will definitely reread. That doesnât happen often.Bottom line: Youâll always be wanting more of Feyreâs story.",book
"âWhen you erupt, girl, make sure it is felt across worlds.âI seriously have no idea where to even begin with this review. I'm going to try not to include any spoilers, but if there are any, I'll give you fair warning before reading further. Honestly, I am absolutely blown away by this novel and it took me several days to adjust to the world after finishing this beautiful book. I honestly don't know how SJM can top this book, but let's get real here...she will because she's just that amazing. I read this in one sitting overnight because I simply couldn't put it down. It's true, this book is a Court of Pain and Feels but it is absolutely mindblowing and I felt incomplete after finishing. SJM seriously took her writing to new heights, and I can't even begin to explain how fantastic it was to experience this journey.âThe great joy and honour of my life has been to know you. To call you my family. And I am grateful - more than I can possibly say - that I was given this time with you all.âI have been such a fan of this series from the very beginning because I always felt that it showed Sarah J. Maas' extreme writing talent. It's so different from the Throne of Glass series, and I loved the creativity and dedication that she puts into this story. You can clearly tell just how much all of these characters mean to her, and every scene is richly described. Her writing truly sweeps you away and it's something that you easily lose yourself in. I know that if someone would ask me tomorrow to leave this world behind and instead go into Feyre's world, I would not even hesitate. This story is complex and I never expected for SJM to build on the world so much more than previously, but she does, and it's excellent. There is a great progression to the story, and this means new faces and new places come into play all while still developing our beloved characters.âWhat we think to be our greatest weakness can sometimes be our biggest strength.âThe book starts with Feyre back in the Spring Court with Tamlin. While some people might have found this part slow, I think it showcased just how far Feyre has come as a character. The strength that it took to go back and set the foundation for her (and Rhysand's) plot was utterly fantastic! I think it helped set up the story perfectly and it showed us Feyre's mindset at the time. I definitely got some Aelin feels in this part because of how awesome and kickass Feyre was, which just added to my love for her character. But the best thing: Feyre's characterization. I thought she was well-developed already, but SJM added yet another layer to her character. Feyre is such a strong and powerful character and has come such a long way since the first book. Looking back, I can't even believe that this is the same person...and that is an excellent thing. It shows how much Rhys and the Night Court have impacted her and aided her in the person she was to ultimately become.âI would have waited five hundred more years for you. A thousand years. And if this was all the time we were allowed to have... the wait was worth it.âRhys is as perfect as ever. I mean come on...who doesn't love him?! The way he treats Feyre made me swoon every darn time, and she is his High Lady in every single way. He gives her something that Tamlin never did...respect. He believes in her and that she can accomplish amazing thing. He allows her to spread her wings (<-- this is an excellent pun btw...I know I'm really not as funny as I think) and embrace her magic. The constant support and love Rhys shows her is something every girl should have. Plus, he's freaking hilarious...you can't get a better man! I honestly will never get enough of him and he will always stay firmly in my top 5 book boyfriends. Obviously the chemistry between Feyre and Rhys is off the charts, and all the sex scenes are perfectly written. I love them together so much, it just makes my heart happy.âIt's a rare person to face who they are and not run from it - not be broken by it.âCassian and Nesta are brilliant and I firmly believe that they will be a focus in one of the upcoming books. I need them together, and I need to have a book with them as the main characters because it will be such an epic story! They have the perfect dynamic that is present throughout the entire book. We learn more about Mor, and my heart broke for her multiple times. I just wanted to give her a giant hug, but I loved delving deeper into her character. Azriel is brooding as ever, but I love him. There is definitely something up with him and Elain, and I need to know what that something is. Amren's sass is pure gold and I love her so much. There are definitely some surprises with her character that left me (along with the characters) shocked. We also meet a new High Lord, Helion and god do I love him! He has to be in these next 3 books because he's awesome. We also see the return of the Bone Carver and the Suriel. And seriously...they play epic roles in the story. And Tamlin...I have to mention this guy. I actually liked how SJM handled him in this book (especially at the end). It was realistic and believable. And (Lord help me), I didn't hate him anymore.âMy rage had become a living thing inside my chest, an echoing heartbeat that soothed me to sleep and stirred me to waking.âMy favorite part about this book though (besides all the other stuff) is its unpredictability. Seriously, SJM gave me a heart attack multiple times. Just when I thought the story was going in one direction and bombshell twist would come out of nowhere and completely change the entire story. And there was not 1, not 2, but 3 major things at the end in which I was freaking out and making very weird noises that I'm sure my neighbors in my apartment building did not appreciate. The one MAJOR (and I mean MAJOR) thing involving a certain character at the end had me with tears in my eyes and my face the picture of shock. I seriously have never been more scared for a character in my life, and I was praying so hard that SJM didn't do what she did. I think I stopped breathing at one point, so HOW DARE YOU SARAH J MAAS!! HOW DARE YOU SCARE ME LIKE THAT!âIt is a new world, and we must decide how we are to end this old one and begin it anew.âIf you couldn't tell, I LOVED this book! I still am not okay after reading the entire battle since SJM made me lose my mind, but everything was tied up nicely and the conclusion was everything I could want. Most of the main questions were answered, but she definitely planted the seeds for a new foe for our group to be facing. I think it would be interesting if the books were from different characters' perspectives, but I'm never going to mind more Feyre and Rhys. This is by far the best read of 2017, and you need to read it as soon as humanly possible!Happy reading :)",book
"ACOWAR has been an interesting change over my course of reading the ACOTAR series. I enjoyed the shift away from deep character development and relationship building toward more political intrigue and solidifying of the world around us.Book three allows us to deepen our already established views of the characters and their relationships, continue to understand the world, while expanding on the larger picture. While we danced with these political issues in the past books, it was a wonderful treat to focus on something new for book three!In addition, we also get to meet new characters while learning about the connections and relationships between our old friends, as well as the new ones. While a lot of the character development felt halted as we built on the political intrigue, I did find myself expanding my thoughts and reconsidering character dynamics.<spoiler>This includes a bit of surprise for me as I started to feel a bit of sympathy for Tamlin and started to consider the trauma that led to his action. Heâs still not the hero in my eyes, and I continue to adore Rhysand, but I do hope to see a happy ending for Tamlin!</spoiler>The emotional connection deepens with each of the books in this series. I continue to find myself with deep emotions throughout!ACOTAR, ACOMAF, and now ACOWAR, continue to tighten their claws around me as I sprint into the fourth book!âThe mix of awe and anger and the realization that the world was large, and beautiful, and sometimes so overwhelming in its wonder that it was impossible to drink it down all at once.â",book
"I could go on for awhile on this but I wont. I will probably not finish the next in the series.The first book was 4.5 stars, then the second was 4, and this was 3, maybe even 2.5. Why low stars? So many reasons, but really it was how i felt after finishing the book: relieved i was done.Rhys and Feyre....So I originally loved them together. They were hot and kept you on your toes. Then they happen in this book and it's boring and cheesy and bland and just plain cringy. Rhys turns into some doe eyed, teary, emotional and not at all bad@ss Fae, like he's originally portrayed. Instead he's the sacrificial lamb he has pined to be, over and over. And we hear about it constantly. 'Oh Rhys, you sacrificed so much for us! Let us repay you!' Rinse, repeat, again and again.Some more examples of constant rinse and repeat? ""This is your choice Feyre, we are a team, i will never take your choice away."" Take that passive aggressiveness Tamlin!! Oh wait, nope, just the reader gets to take it, over and over and over....each and every time the author reminds us of FEYRE's choice!!!!!Lets talk Tamlin shall we. Feyre did him dirty. I know I know, Im SURE Im in the minority here. But it just aggravates me when the whole point of contention in books is boiled down to a simple lack of communication. And that really was all it was. She fell out of love, moved on, but no one really told Tamlin! So he went under the wrong assumptions for so long. It really was aggravating. He was kind to her and truly loved her. Sure, he eventually said some terrible things to her. But a man scorned he was!! And really, if she was simply more upfront with him than her lousy letter, 'i wish you well' or something dumb like that, I wouldnt be all up in arms about it!The book is LONG. Very long. And yet we get nothing of Lucian and his new mate. Like nothing. They still have only had maybe 2 whole sentences between each other by the end of this 700+ page book. So I have no idea if they are even covered in the other books.Now dont think i forgot Nesta. Ugh I wish i would. Shes a raging B, pretty much 99% of the book. It gets old real fast. Yet she's written like a hero to save their day! She's written essentially: oh, she has problems with dealing with things and expressing her emotions well, so it's ok she treats everyone else like trash. She has an excuse. ....I hate that shiz. Just because you are sad or mad or hurting, does not give you the right to hurt others. Nesta says to Feyre, 'why didnt you tell us you couldnt read, i did not now and would have helped you.' Yeah, sure B. You treated Feyre like a sack of doo doo, and never truly worried about her when she was dangerously hunting for the family, or freezing to death or whatever other sacrifices Feyre made while you never.once.said.thanks! So no, Nesta gets no free pass from me. She never once redeemed herself in this book and I am only sorry Cassian is stuck with her frozen hearted soul.The whole Mor and Azrial thing. Sad. Like why make us think one thing, only to make it sooo much less fulfilling. I loved Azrial, and his soft spoken, loyal soul. Only to have to deal with whatever the heck Mor has going on. Talk about stringing someone along for.....zillions of years.Just disappointed with this book. When i invested so much time, i expected a bit more i suppose. Don't get me wrong. There were good parts. But for me, the bad parts made this book a 2.5 star read for me.",book
"Love, love,love this author and series! When I finished the first book in this series, I HAD to get the next one ASAP! But when I read the synopsis of the next 2 books, my heart dropped into my bunny ð slippers, and I thought my head would explode! The plot was heading to people and places I did NOT want to contemplate! I had to put the brakes on and REALLY consider whether I wanted to go in that direction. After MUCH thought, I decided that since the first book was SO GREAT that I 'd have to trust the author to make it all work out. But I was only willing to get book 2...just in case. So as I started reading, I kept worrying that I would not be able to complete it. But thank the ""Mother"", ( and the author), I did. And I was SO glad! I was amazed at the author's plotting skills! I loved it more than the first book! At that point, I bought the rest of the series. And 2 of her other series! Sarah J. Maas, I will NEVER doubt you again! Thanks!",book
"(5/5â­ï¸) âMy rage had become a living thing inside my chest, an echoing heartbeat that soothed me to sleep and stirred me to waking.â âSarah J MaasFeyre is ready to fight in this final installment of the ACOTAR trilogy (not counting the novella). Having failed to damage the cauldron in ACOMAF, Feyre is taken into the Spring Court under the guise of having been brainwashed. Tamlin believes her leaving him was all Rhysandâs doing. She encourages this misbelief, determined to rip apart Tamlinâs court from the inside. Meanwhile, the King of Hybern is done staging his troops for war. Heâs ready to bring Prythian to its knees. He plans to strike hard at the wall, then sweep across the land and take all the courts. The only way to stop him is to unite all the High Lords, and even then it might not be enough. It will take something short of a miracle to bring him down. But the world has some unexpected allies in the form of monsters. It also has Feyre, Amren, Nesta and Elain. These strong women are unlike others for more than one reason, but especially because they are âmade.â They just might have what it takes to save everyone, even if it kills them.Crying!!!! Iâm CRYING. Or I was. I donât remember the last time I cried so much in a book. Happy tears. Sad tears. Sometimes I was just crying because of how emotional this book made me. Like Rhysandâs little circle up before the final battle (which reminded me a lot of the final battle in LOTR btw). Rhysandâs words to all his friends. This might be the last time they are all together. That was all I could think as tears washed down my face. As a sense of foreboding and fear settled over me. Deep down I was thinking, SJM wouldnât DARE kill ANY of them...right?!...right?!âI believe everything happens for a reason. Whether it is decided by the Mother, or the Cauldron, or some sort of tapestry of Fate, I don't know. I don't really care. But I am grateful for it, whatever it is. Grateful that it brought you all into my life. If it hadn't... I might have become as awful as that prick we're going to face today.âThe plot in this book was faster paced than ACOMAF. A lot faster. Everything happens in rapid succession. Thereâs NO time to catch your breath. Feyre is in Spring Court for the first part, bringing it down, and then running for her life, and thereâs the meeting of the High Lordsâwhich was OMG, tenseâand the attack at the library, all the battles. You get the picture. Itâs GO GO GO.In terms of world building, SJM really tied things off nicely. I loved her introduction of some of the monsters, giving us an even deeper glimpse into Prythian. Like the use of the Weaver, the Bone Carver, and the creature from the depths of the library for the war. We got to see all the High Lords together. We got to see more magic. Everything was brought to a nice close in that regard.There was still PLENTY of romance, and hints of new romance to come, like Cassian and Nesta (SO excited for their upcoming novella), and Elain and Lucian...? If that ever happens.âNesta looked at the king with death twining around his hands, then down at Cassian. And covered Cassianâs body with her own. Cassian went still - then his hand slid over her back. Together. Theyâd go together.âI really liked the way Rhysand and Feyreâs relationship strengthened, too. That he trusted her with things as dangerous as sneaking in to the King of Hybernâs camp to rescue her sister spoke VOLUMES:âYou do not fear. You do not falter. You do not yield. You go in, you get her, and you come out again.âWOW. That quote though. Those two are my favorite bookish couple of ALL TIME. Hands down. He could have insisted on doing it himself. Or even sending someone else. But he trusted Feyre because she was confident that she could succeed.In terms of character development, where the last book was Feyre healing, I felt this book was her coming into her own. She really learned how to take matters into her own hands, how to be strong, how to make her own decisions. She definitely did some growing, with Rhysandâs encouragement no less. She looked into the mirror and saw who she really was, and she accepted that.The other character arc that stood out to me was Tamlinâs, even though it happened mostly in the background. He went from feeling he owned Feyre, to finally accepting that she wasnât his, but even more: he saved her life. That, in my eyes, fully redeemed him. I still find fault with him, and heâs not my favorite, BUT he saved her life.The ending was a little surprising but very satisfying for me. I really didnât expect Amarin to come back, but she did and Iâm happier for it. I liked that she came back changed. And...Rhysand dying? That was...Iâm not sure. At first I thought it was unnecessary, but the more I think about it, I think it was necessary BECAUSE we needed Tamlin to be the final say in the matter. We needed that final acorn of life from him. We NEEDED to see that Tamlin had FINALLY accepted Feyreâs choice. That he would rather see Feyre happy, even if it meant he couldnât have her. That, to me, tied off his character arc nicely.This series has become my absolute favorite. I say that about a lot of books, but thereâs no question here. I recommend it to everyone who loves darker fantasy, political intrigue, strong female leads, sexy fae...you name it! I am glad there are two novellas for me to read soon. One I have and will get to soon, the other coming in January (YESSS). So...go read this series!",book
"*****Spoilers*****A fantastic written work! I am a sucker for happy endings, well mostly a happy ending anyway, at least in this book. Feyre and Rhys and crew jetting off constantly to face danger and war and try to make their world a better place. They accomplished much and have the makings for the peace and unity they crave so hopefully things will go well if there's another book to this series.I did not like Feyre's plan or execution of her plan to deceive Tamlin. Faking her feelings to get out from under Hybern was prudent in the moment but when she went back to the Spring court and sowed discontent and disrupted the trust Tamlin's court had in him, I was let down. Especially since Tamlin's actions at the time were in an attempt to save Feyre, misguided though his goals were. I'd have much preferred if Feyre disappeared from Spring again after talking to Tamlin. Too, I never really bought into Feyre's hatred of Tamlin. Yes he stifled her and locked her in his house with wards up and it was devastating after her stay under the mountain but it wasn't so egregious in my opinion to garner such strong dislike from Feyre. Tamlin loses her and Lucian from his court at the same time in a nest of King Hybern's goals. It's just that much sadder to find that Tamlin was trying to fight against the King through the keeping his enemies close adage. And he comes through for her in the end when she and Azriel go to that enemy camp to save her sister Elain. My hope would be that Tamlin finds himself a mate down the line, he's been battered enough, I think.Rhys. Oh Rhys. I liked him under the mountain when he was bad but knowing the truth behind the mask is perfect too. He makes mistakes but his heart is in the right place and his selflessness and attempts to shield others so takes more on himself in sacrifice of everything he has and is breaks me when he dies putting it into repairing the cauldron. Thankfully the other High Lords survive the battlefield and give them his essence plus Fayre so that he's resurrected. I wouldn't have liked the outcome had he remained dead but it does make me wonder if it would work for all of the other High Lords? And what that knowledge will mean in future for the courts.Thank you for FINALLY revealing the story behind Mor's inability to love Azriel the way he desires. The next step is for her to actually tell him that she prefers women. I like Azriel the best and he should hear what she says so that he can move on fully, I think. I also want Mor to be happy with whoever she chooses without fear of what others think. It's curious though that Mor has her sexuality hanging over her head when one of the high lords has a same sex mate. Makes no sense.Cassian and Nesta have the beginnings of something, if she'll allow it. The care is evident between them but after the final battle, she seemed to withdraw instead of move forward on what they were building together. Her desperate cries for him on the battlefield saved his life so I'd think she'd be loathe to waste more time.Amsen was a surprise. I didn't realize what she was doing when she slammed the book shut just after Fayre touched the cauldron but no way did I ever think Amsen was a traitor. Tricks up her sleeve she had but my thought was that she and Nesta had figured it out and Nesta would have to be the sacrifice, especially since Nesta was the most connected to the cauldron. Amsen sacrificed herself but again, she was brought back by Rhys. No longer otherworldly, just high fae but she's there in the end and hopefully can build something with Varian.Lucian has almost no role in this book which I thought was disappointing but it was cute seeing his reactions to and around Elain. He's so careful and considerate and clearly wants the bond but is being patient. Wish them both happiness in whatever future they have but I think it'll be a while for Elain. She's still clearly devastated by her mortal mate Greyson's reaction to her fae transformation. It was incongruous that the gentle son (as previously portrayed) was more harsh and unforgiving than his father (who had been portrayed as just that intolerant of fae). Elain is almost child-like in this book and doesn't interact much with everyone else. I forgot about her until the cauldron snatched her away. That she was the one who stabbed King Haybern wasn't a surprise to me but given her nature to that point, I'm glad she seemed to take something of herself back.Outside of Rhys, my favorite high lord was Helion. Can't put a finger on exactly why but maybe because I sense he needs something more to his life. That he's probably Lucian's father was a revelation that was a shock but I wished Feyre or someone had told them both. Lucian's mother loves Helion but is married to Baron whom his son Eris is plotting to kill. I'm not sure what that would then mean for his mother and Helion but only time will tell if there are more books written.",book

I kept seeing this book all over tik tok and dismissed it as just another book. Then I went to a therapy session and she recommended I get it. DANG IT. I bought it and HOLY CRAP. YES....YES you need this in your life. So much of what we struggle with in adulthood stem from our childhood. Until we make peace with those issues we continue the cycle. Order it... order it now. You won't be sorry unless you can't put it down like me haha,book
"This journal has definitely shown me some of the unhealthy patterns in my life but definitely opened old wounds. I don't recommend using this book without a therapist or similar counselor.With all the negative past experiences getting dredged up, I definitely spiraled into a very negative mindset. I had to put it aside for a while.There are some things about the book that I don't agree with, which mostly borderline on toxic positivity. And I felt reassured in feeling that way when my therapist also picked up on it.This can be a very useful tool for bringing out emotions and experiences that you tend to hide from yourself and others. When you bring them into the light, you can start to address and accept what you've gone through and how you feel about yourself.",book
The day I opened this book i have not put it down.. great book to understand your self and open your eyes about things. Donât hesitate buy this book its worth the money,book

"As a lifelong Harry Potter superfan, I was so excited to get my hands on MinaLima's newest interactive papercraft edition. Their creative details blew me away! The moving Marauder's Map footsteps and Grim peeking out from the teacup were pure magic.While the Monster Book cover is gorgeous, my favorite part was the brilliantly crafted seasonal edges for Halloween and Christmas - a wonderful immersive touch. MinaLima's artistry reminds me exactly how I imagined the Wizarding World before the films came out.These stunning editions are a must-have addition to any Potter collector's shelf, even if you already own the series in other formats. I simply can't resist the magic of MinaLima's imaginative, interactive art. It transports me right back to the wonder of discovering Harry's world as a kid.I tend to keep these primarily for personal use due to their interactive nature. However, responsible older kids can enjoy them with care. Either way, I already can't wait for MinaLima's next release! For fellow lifelong Potterheads, these books are a dream brought to life.",book
"I already owned the entire series in a nice hardcover set, but when I saw this I had to add it to my library.While amazon clumsily ships this in an envelope, rather than a box, it managed to arrive intact and without any dents in the corners, by some miracle.Every inch of this is just remarkable, from the faux aging on the pages to the clever popup features and the gorgeous graphics throughout, it's a treasure.I don't have children, and I was 33 when I bought my first HP book way back when, but you're never too old for Magic. This is a gift for the kid in me and I quickly ordered the first two special editions as well. I can't wait to see what they do with Goblet of Fire, as that was always my second favourite book in the series, after this one.If you're on the fence, get it. If you love these wonderful books you won't regret it one iota.",book
"Minalima's interactive papercraft is always beautiful, but the Grim being uncovered in the teacup and the moving footsteps on the Marauder's map were absolutely brilliant creative details. My photo is of the ""Monster's Book of Monsters"" but my favorite details were actually the seasonal detailed edges for Halloween and Christmas. I already have the original HP books in hardcover, kindle, audible, and the first five art books done by Jim Kay and I still HAVE to buy these MinaLima versions because they are magical. They remind me of the original images at the start of each chapter and encapsulate the way I imagined the Wizarding World to be before the movies and the other art that came out later. Absolutely stunning addition to my shelf and I am already looking forward to the next one. This will be used primarily by an adult but I have let children (9-13) read and use my MinaLima versions and have never had an issue. They are careful children though, who take care of things.",book

Love these editions. The art style is perfect for the material. I have discovered that I donât enjoy having the pop-up items in the pages of my book though.

"I love Freida McFaddenâs writing; she always keeps me guessing. And her newest book, The Coworker, is no exception.Natalie Farrell is a sales Representative and Dawn Schiff is an accountant at Vixed, a nutritional supplement company. Natalie is beautiful and popular, and everything seems to come so easily for her. Dawn is the complete opposite, she is socially awkward, plain looking and her only real friend is her childhood best friend, Mia. They do have one thing in common though, they both have dark secrets. When Dawn goes missing, Natalie finds herself in the middle and her perfect life is blown apart.Dawn is always at her desk at 8:45am sharp. So, when Natalie showed up to work at 9:00 and Dawn was not at her desk, she stopped and did a double take. Where is Dawn? She is always on time and has never taken a sick day. No one else in the office is all that concerned that Dawn is not in, but Natalie cannot shake the feeling that something is wrong. When the phone on Dawnâs desk rings, Natalie answers it and the voice on the other end sounds like Dawn and she whispers, âhelp meâ. Natalie takes it upon herself to drive to Dawnâs house and check on her. When she enters Dawnâs house through the unlocked back door, Natalie is shocked by what she sees. Dawnâs living room is covered in blood, but Dawn is nowhere to be found. When the police start their investigation, they uncover information that makes them set their sights on Natalie. Natalie is now in a cat and mouse game, and she must find out what happened to Dawn and why someone is framing her.I cannot say too much about what happens because I think it is best to go into this book blind. But I will say I wasnât sure who to believe or trust while I was reading. At first, I liked Natalie because she came across as such a nice person. Every year she has a charity 5K run event to help raise funds for Muscular Dystrophy, in honor of her friend she lost to the disease. Natalie also always seemed to go out of her way to be nice to Dawn, though they were not best friends, Natalie considered Dawn to be a friend. But then we get Dawnâs POV via emails she sent to her childhood best friend, Mia. In these emails Natalie comes across as a very different person, according to Dawn, Natalie was a bully. I loved getting these two sides because it made both Natalie and Dawn unreliable characters.The Coworker was full of so many twists and turns. Just when I thought I may know what was going on, a twist would come and point me in another direction. So many times I found my jaw drop and would be like âWhat?!â. If you are looking for a twisty psychological thriller, then I definitely recommend Freida McFaddenâs The Coworker.",book
"This is the second of McFaddenâs books that Iâve read. McFadden does create significant suspense in this story, and I wanted to find out how it would end. I figured out a portion of the plot beforehand, but was still anxious to see what would happen next.Natalie and Dawn are polar opposites. Natalie is blonde, vivacious, extroverted and successful.Sheâs a hard-charging sales rep for a Boston-based health supplement company. Sheâs well-liked, motivated and used to getting what she wants.In contrast, Dawn is quiet, reserved, shy and more-than-a-little quirky. Sheâs rigidly punctual, socially awkward and desperately eager to connect with her coworkers, often with disastrous results. Sheâs a dedicated accountant at the same company as Natalie, but she exists in the background and on the sidelines.Then one day, Dawn doesnât show up for work.This wouldnât be particularly unusual for a typical employee, but itâs definitely out of character for Dawn, whose schedule is consistent and unwavering. While out on a sales call, Natalie impulsively decides to go to Dawnâs home to check on her, and to see if anything is amiss. Natalie enters through an unlocked back door and finds a large bloodstain on the living room carpet. Shaken, she calls the police.An investigation begins that centers around Dawnâs various colleagues because she seemed to have few friends and little family.The assigned detective pursues various leads, but increasingly circles back to Natalie and her possible involvement. Natalieâs puzzled and then fearful when she becomes the central focus and primary suspect in the investigation, when the battered body of an unidentified woman is found.The story moves between the search for Dawn and Natalieâs racheting alarm at the mounting evidence against her. She worries that someone is trying to frame her for murder, and watches helplessly as former friends turn against her. McFadden does an excellent job at depicting the juxtaposition of the two womenâs lives as they intersect and unravel. Lots of adrenaline and pages turning in a flurry. I was surprised by how invested I was, given my earlier reaction to McFaddenâs other book, âNever Lieâ. This one had a slightly more redemptive message, though the darker undertones are still ever-present in this book as well. McFadden seems to favor shady characters with sinister edges, complicated backstories and subjective motivations. As a thriller, it works, but I wouldnât want to encounter people like this in real life.",book
"So, at first, it seemed rather pedestrian, but still got my attention. THEN, the more I read I could make connections between the characters and people I actually work with. Thatâs when I knew I was hooked!While you may get thrown off by parts of the story being told via emails between characters, itâs a plot devise that makes sense once you get 3/4 through the story. Similar to the use of newspaper articles and such telling you the story of what happened at the prom in Stephen Kingâs âCarrie.âThatâs all I will say here.Once again, I got caught up in the emotional drama of the main characters, that I missed the clues that were right there in front of me.This is definitely an easy read, but it is engrossing and a fun way to spend the weekend, when the weather is crappy and youâre having a cup of coffee or chocolate, and need a good book to get you through. Yup, itâs a page turner, and a fun roller-coaster ride, if you stick with it.You will enjoy the fact that the protagonists are also antagonists and need each other to get out of the mess they created. Job well done, Freida!",book
"I meanâ¦ Freida does it again.An ending that you know is coming because whatâs a Freida book without a twist and yetâ¦ still shocked. I really donât even know how to rate this but because I flew through it in 24 hours itâs getting 4 stars.Ok so firstâ¦ yea Dawn is portrayed as a bit strange. Letâs get that out the way.Without giving spoilers away, you will question EVERYONE in this story. I thought everyone was delusional at one point and weâre all having side effects from some supplement from Vixed.Overall this book is a page turner. I donât know how I feel about the end and of course there are questions but overall they both end up having been really sucky people.If you like Freidaâs writing youâll enjoy this one.",book
"A definite thriller - it had me hooked until the very end. Natalie and Dawn work together, Dawn seemingly a little weird, Natalie the top dog at their company, Vixed.Until one day, Dawn doesn't show up for work. Ever so meticulous and methodically predictable, Natalie is worried about her and goes to their boss to explain that Dawn is missing. Seth, their boss, doesn't seem too upset - and says she will be along shortly, not thinking anything is wrong. Until Natalie goes back to her desk and hears Dawns phone ringing in her cubicle. Unaware, she picks up the phone to hear a meek ""Help me,"" and the caller hangs up. Could Dawn be in trouble? It's only then that Natalie begins down a dark web of mystery, full of lies, deceit, and even a case of manipulation and possibly.... murder?",book
"Frieda McFadden has done it again. This is my second title of hers and I really enjoy the quick, easy to read, thrillers she puts out. The Coworker is comprised of two unreliable, and rather unlikable, FMCs and just enough WTF is going on suspense to make you want to binge read the entire book in one sitting. I enjoyed the suspense and plot twists, both of which were present throughout the book. I consumed this title as both an audio book and ebook. The narrator for the audio book was great. It's a short read, so it's fast paced by nature. Overall, The Coworker, is an easy and enjoyable thriller.Overall: â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸â­ï¸",book
"Iâve been looking forward to reading this story (âthe turtle storyâ lol ;) for a long time.I am a huge fan of Freida McFaddenâs work in general. She is a phenomenal wordsmith â one of the cream of the crop psychological thriller authors of our day. And, I honestly think her work is so amazing, it will stand the test of time & be just as relevant decades into the future.The Coworker is simply one of those books you gobble up â most especially to reach the end to learn all the secrets going on âbetween the lines.âI think itâs interesting that McFadden never chose to actually STATE, in any fashion, that one of the primary characters is autistic. ??This is big miss in regard to educating the general public about autistic women/people. But â¦. this wasnât a non-fiction book. Iâm just disappointed the author never revealed exactly WHY this person is the way they are, other than, âodd, strange, weird, a target of bullying,â etcâ¦.Just a paragraph ANYWHERE, would have been great. Even in her âAcknowledgments,â or other personal messages from McFadden at the end of the story.In any case â I absolutely enjoyed this story. Loved every single one of the characters. The plot. The exciting conclusion.And I actually have a new appreciation for, & a wealth of random facts about, all types of turtles! Lol! ;)",book
"Hooboy - Buckle up, buttercup, because this was a WILD ride. This was my first Freida book, and I was NOT disappointed.

WRONGThe suspense was REAL in this book. I was hooked from the get-go. I had to know where Dawn was, if she was dead, and was Natalie really capable, or was she just a scapegoat?The only thing keeping me from giving this 5 stars was the fact I just couldn't stand Dawn's long ass emails. ð¤£ I mean.

"groundbreaking book that explores the stark contrast in financial mindsets between the rich and the poor, as well as the middle class. Through the story of his two fathers, his biological father (financially struggling) and his best friend's father (wealthy and wise), Kiyosaki imparts essential financial lessons.The book emphasizes the significance of financial education, asset accumulation, and investing in one's financial future. Kiyosaki challenges conventional beliefs about money and advocates for acquiring assets that generate income, rather than relying solely on traditional employment.",book

The book pays tribute to Robert Kiyosaki's two Dads, who may have held differing points of view, but both of whom made a profound impact on his life.

"This is a fun continuation of the beloved series. I was a little thrown off when I saw this was a 6th book in the original lighting Thief series. (I had not really been paying attention). As I had originals read these books with my daughter, it was not on the top of list of things to pay attention to. My Daughter who counted herself a daughter of Apollo, lived an breathed this story when she was in grade school. I have so many wonderful memories of sitting and talking with her. Going over the adventures and how she would feel in the various situations. As my daughter is now 23 and I often miss her being young, this book is an amazing reminder to embrace all stages of life. I look forward to reading the last 2 books, feeling nostalgia for the time past and approaching the future as an adventure.",book
"This book brought me back to a time when things were a little easier, and I was first dipping my toes into actually reading novels instead of flipping through picture books.I wonât give too much away, but as I was reading through some pages, I realized that a lot of the scenes in the book were vaguely familiar. It didnât take me long to realize that this book resembled the first Percy Jackson bookâThe Lightning Thief.Donât get me wrong, itâs a different book entirely, and it stands on its own pretty well, but it definitely has a similar spark to the first one. As I was reading through it, I felt like a kid again, cracking open the first book after getting my hands on the whole set from a scholastic book fair catalog order I had placed with my literature teacher.With that said, I couldnât put the book down. It was a quick read, but delightful nonetheless. I highly recommend to anyone in the mood for something light and fictional, or a Percy Jackson fan wanting to add another classic Greek âmythâ to their collection.",book
"The story is as charming as a regular reader of Riordan has come to expect. (If youâre NOT a regular reader, why not?) There is less action than usual, but the snarky asides from the narrator (the ever reliable Percy Jackson) are definitely present, full humour quotient in place.But What The Hell is up with the changing fonts every few words??? From serif to non-serif and back and forth again and again. There are few things as annoying in a novel than anomalies that pull the reader out of the story, and this font switching is high on the annoyance list. If these were to stress some words, as seems to be the case in some instances, why not use italics in the common manner? This font thing is unacceptable!Or is this a problem in the formatting when uploading the digital version? If thatâs the issue, for the sake of all the gods fix it and fix it now. Then arrange for a corrected version to be downloaded to every person who spent actual money for this. You canât treat loyal fans this way.Cheers.",book
"SPOILER FREE REVIEW: I enjoyed every page. This book was completely full of classic Riordan-charm, and brought me right back to when I first opened The Lightning Thief.In this book, Percy reflects on what his life might look like beyond the dangers of being a teenage Demigod, and in this, offers us readers a chance to reflect on who we were when we first discovered PJO, and who we are becoming today. Riordan navigated this parallel with brilliant ease.My *only* sticking point is, It did not feel like an ending to a two decade adventureâit feels like the first book of a new trilogy. And, being only 268 pages, it was significantly shorter than most of the books in this universe, so I finished the book happy, but ultimately craving more.",book
"I love Percy Jackson. I read the original series growing up and this book felt like a blast from the past. It gets back to the original seriesâ roots with punny jokes and Percy being Percy. We see a return to the sarcastic and lovable Percy from the original series.My only issue with the book was that it felt kinda rushed, and I wouldâve loved to see more of the scenes expanded on. It was shorter than the other books, and was definitely a return to less dark material, especially considering Heroes of Olympus had Percy/Annabeth fighting for their lives in Tartarus. This was a return to the light and levity that is Rick Riordan - has me wanting to reread all the books over again!",book
"Loved this book! It was so nice to get back into Percyâs head after so long and revisit the lovely relationship between the core trio. This is not the most high stakes, dramatic book in Rickâs catalogue but itâs just cozy and nostalgic and fun. Questing for recommendation letters is a much chiller end goal than the series usual saving the world fare, but had moments of legitimate tension too. Highly recommend for readers of the original series!",book
What a treat!! A new PJO book without a big âend of the worldâ threat! Itâs perfect! Thereâs a quest but itâs less stressful than the past ones. You get to see the original trio and Percy balancing his quest with his daily life for once!The quest was still thrilling and the humour was on point as always!I loved it!,book
"This is so good. I've only read the first 5-6 chapters but they are amusing and start off with that classic ""look I didn't want to be"" line. IM 17 and this is still a book I can enjoy freely and openly with my friends. I know it may seem a little immature for someone my age but the stories become more mature and dark as you read each book. The sarcasm and humor still stay but the books become more descriptive with the battles and carnage. this was a welcome change. No saving the world just Percy being Percy, and by that I mean being a total idiot and getting him and his incredibly bad luck in every bad situation possible",book
"Percy learns that he needs to get letters of recommendation from gods for his acceptance to New Rome University with Annabeth. But it's not that simple. He needs to do quests to earn them. This is the story of his first quest. I didn't think that the story was quite as good as the previous books, but it wasn't bad either. It felt like it was written down to a younger age level than the other books. Also, Riordan's switching from serif to non-serif fonts, instead of using italics, was both odd and annoying. It tended to cause a break in concentration.",book
"Percy Jackson and the Olympians is my favorite book series of all time, and âChalice of the Godsâ did NOT disappoint! i am extra excited for the next one, everyone should be reading this!!!!",book

"The books are small and pretty short. They're a little flimsy so would not recommend for smaller children.

Amazing for the kids that just start learning how to read!,book
"I ordered all 3 sets of these books for my Kindergartner. He already recognizes a bunch of sight words and I wanted to get a great collection of books that would give him lots of practice and lots of success! I taught reading enrichment classes to early readers for ~9 years, so I knew what I was looking for; these are perfect for getting a youngster started!Another reviewer complained that the sets did not differ in difficulty from A to B to C, but I have to disagree. In my picture, a book from set A is at the top, set B in the middle, and set C at the bottom. All three are alike in their simple sentence structure, but there are key differences. Set A books use a very short sentence, usually with only one word changing per page. This lets the child read independently, recognizing the pattern and using visual clues to figure out unknown words, thereby experiencing a lot of success and feeling pride in their reading skills. Set B uses slightly longer sentences or even two sentences per page, and the words that change frequently have more syllables. The pictures still help with figuring it out, though, so your child can move through the text comfortably, learning to not be intimidated by long words (very important!). Set C books seem to focus on words that have challenging phonics elements (like ""grew"" -- not an easy word to sound out until you've learned that digraph, which usually happens sometime in mid 1st grade) or longer and more diverse sentences with multi-syllabic words. Don't get me wrong; these books are little half steps in the reading process and are all early-mid Kindergarten level, but in setting up your child for success -- giving them confidence and the willingness to try -- these early experiences are crucial! I am very pleased with the purchase and am excited for my kid to try them.UPDATE 10/1/21 -- I will modify my above statement for at least one of the books. In the A set, there is a book called ""Almost Spring"" that I feel belongs in set B or possibly even set C. It uses the present participle (-ing) on almost every page, and while a child at this level may know or be able to figure out the root word (for instance, ""melt"" or ""peep""), they are very likely to be thrown by ""melting"" and ""peeping."" Just remember to give your child lots of support and encouragement when they read, and if they seem to be struggling, just tell them the word and let them move on. :)P.S. Other people reported getting some duplicates in their boxes; I did not. Seems to be random. Perhaps if you get a duplicate the seller could send you the right one.Customer image",book

"My kid only read Rick Riordan (Percy Jackson and Magnus Chase) and rejected everything else. Someone loaned us Hatchet, and she never stopped talking about it. I had to buy her her own copy and itâs now a treasured friend.Something about the way Brian used all of his determination to survive alone in the wilderness spoke to my kids at a visceral level. Itâs written in a way thatâs accessible, human and thrilling, and has generated many conversations in our household.",book
"Brian was on the way to visit his father in the oil fields of Canada after his parentsâ recent divorce. But midflight, the pilot of the small Cessna had a heart attack and died, leaving Brian alone in a plane flying hundreds of miles off course. The plane finally crashed in a remote Canadian lake, leaving Brian stranded with nothing but a small hatchet and the clothes on his back. This is a story of survival and determination.WHAT I LIKED: The author had experienced many of the same things that Brian experienced in the book, so he was able to write with a realism and urgency not seen in a book like My Side of the Mountain. It was a bit more grotesque than I expected.WHAT I DIDNâT LIKE: I feel like the book wouldnât have suffered if Paulsen had omitted the tornado scene. It felt a little forced to me.",book
This was so much better than I ever thought it would be. Highly recommend for 4th grade and above. Couldnât put it down!,book

"Read this when I was a kid! Still love it! Just as much now, if not more!",book
"I read Hatchet for the first time many years ago -- probably 1988, when it became a Newbery Honor book. Not all Newbery books are great, but this one was. Being reminded of it recently, I noticed that it is the first book of a series of five, most of which I have never read, so I decided to go back to it.Hatchet is the story of thirteen-year-old Brian Robeson. Brian sets off as a passenger in a single-engine bush plane to visit his father in northern Canada. On the way, the pilot dies in a heart attack. Brian, whom the pilot had been showing how to fly the plane before his heart attack, manages to crash the plane in a lake in the forest. He survives the crash, but then has the problem of surviving until he is rescued. He DOES survive (not a spoiler, since the publisher's blurb tells us that this is a ""story of survival"").You would naturally imagine this to be an action-packed story, but it really is not. There are a few exciting moments, most conspicuously the crash and the tornado (also mentioned in the blurb). It is mostly about Brian figuring out how to survive -- how to feed himself and remain safe from danger. And survival, it turns out, depends on wisdom. Brian learns to see the wild world he inhabits and to know its meanings. I am tempted to say that Brian becomes wise, but I think that's unfair to him. Brian was wise, but his wisdom needed to be brought to the fore.In an epilog, Gary Paulsen tells us that Brian is forever changed by this experience.""When the pilot rescued Brian he had been alone on the L-shaped lake for fifty-four days. During that time he had lost seventeen percent of his body weight. He later gained back six percent, but had virtually no body fatâhis body had consumed all extra weight and he would remain lean and wiry for several years.""Many of the changes would prove to be permanent. Brian had gained immensely in his ability to observe what was happening and react to it; that would last him all his life. He had become more thoughtful as well, and from that time on he would think slowly about something before speaking.""When I read that, I felt oddly envious. I caught myself wishing that something like this could happen to me. Of course, I don't really. I don't want to be trapped in the forests of northern Ontario for 8 weeks all on my own. I'm happy here with my books and movies and grocery stores and microwave oven. But, let us just say, Hatchet shows me something of what those cost me.Hatchet is brief -- about a two-hour read. And yes, there is indeed a hatchet involved. The story has a real feeling of authenticity.",book
My boys and I just finished this book and we all loved it. It was exciting and suspenseful. They were on the edge of their seats.,book
Exciting read for pre to early teen. Teaches survival life skills.,book
"âAs a tale gets passed from one person to another, it ripples out until it is as wide and mythic as the sea.âThe annals of British naval history abound with great and small adventures alike. None, however, captivates like the extraordinary tale of the HMS Wager. And no one can better recount such a hair-raising series of events than David Grann. With ""The Wager,"" Grann tops his previous works of narrative nonfiction with this harrowing story of inconceivable hardship and the machinations of desperate men. To be sure, no incident contained in this book is without ample evidence proving it occurred.It is hard to imagine a more horrifying set of survival conditions than those faced by Wager's crew, and capturing those conditions accurately based on aging historical records and biased published accounts was undoubtedly tricky. Yet, Grann does yeoman's work on this story of the ill-fated Wager, part of a British squadron ordered to sea in August 1740 against the Spanish in the apocryphal âWar of Jenkinsâ Ear."" Commanding Wager and at the center of Grann's book is Captain David Cheap, a deeply flawed and complicated skipper.Like Grann's other books, ""The Wager"" nearly requires one to suspend disbelief. The author carefully and patiently reveals the story's events, shocking the reader in the process. Moreover, upon completing Grann's 257-page account of Wager's exploits and those of its sister ship, HMS Centurion, the reader better understands the ruthlessness and cunning demonstrated by the British Royal Navy as it navigated the high seas in quest of Empire. Indeed, British imperial ambitions are fully displayed in ""The Wager.""Based mainly on seamenâs logbooks and trial records, many of which are over 250 years old, Grann pieces together the seemingly doomed Wagerâs calamities while providing ample historical context. The author, for example, details the multitudinous threats facing British ships as they pursued the Empire's aims in the mid-18th century. He also describes shipboard conditions on a British man-of-war sailing the world's oceans during this era.Wager meets its fate while searching for a Spanish galleon laden with treasure and attempting to negotiate the treacherous seas off Cape Horn at the tip of the South American continent. The crew, already decimated by storms, scurvy, and sundry other trials, finds its ship dashed on the rocks off the coast of Patagonia, Argentina. Marooned in May 1741 with little hope of rescue, the men struggle to survive on a scabrous spit of land subsequently named Wager Island.Malnourished and desperate, Wagerâs surviving company suffers a complete breakdown in discipline and decorum. Having lost confidence in the ailing and unpredictable Cheap, still in command, the castaways defy British naval law and flout regulations. A fulminant Cheap, for his part, opposes the indiscipline and enforces his authority at the end of a pistol. A mutiny takes shape, and eventually, a breakaway faction, led by Gunner's Mate John Bulkeley, abandons Cheap and his loyalists, leaving them to fend for themselves on Wager Island. By this time, subsisting on the meagerest of diets harvested from terrain that barely sustains life while withstanding storm after storm, Cheap and crew somehow endure.Sailing a small transport boat reinforced with scrap lumber harvested from Wager and equipped with makeshift sails and rigging, Bulkeley and his charges successfully navigate the Strait of Magellan to Brazil. Meanwhile, Cheap and the Wager Island stragglers experience an equally implausible outcome. Sailing on an eighteen-foot yawl salvaged from the Wager, they set off to reach the Chilean coast. Surviving their respective ordeals, the two parties return to London, providing their lurid accounts of mutiny, betrayal, abandonment, and murder to an incredulous British Admiralty and fascinated public. They alternately face scorn and approbation and, eventually, court-martial.It is the Wager leadershipâs trial for which Grann saves his best narration and jaw-dropping, surprise ending.""The Wager"" asks which of the stories is harder to believe: the death-defying travails and travels of these indomitable seamen or the unanticipated result as the British Admiralty adjudicates their fate. Yet, Grann provides the reader with all the evidence necessary to confirm these events happened irrefutably. Relying on an abundance of journals, logs, diaries, and even letters, Grann demonstrates again his seemingly unquenchable thirst for the truth to inform his audience. His single-spaced bibliography alone exceeds 13 pages.Without question, ""The Wager"" is an astonishing naval story reminiscent of Charles Nordhoffâs and James Norman Hallâs âMutiny on the Bounty.â Considering the inglorious actions of the Wager's crew, Grann's book is worth reading and rereading to comprehend the motives of desperate men. Experiencing the audacity and might of the 18th century British Royal Navy, particularly exemplified by Centurion as she squares off with the Spanish man-of-war Our Lady of Covadonga off the Philippines, provides immensely satisfying adventure reading. Grann's spellbinding account of the naval gunfight puts the reader in the crow's nest as though he is viewing the fight aboard the Centurion from the very mast top!""The Wager"" offers an incredible piece of storytelling suitable for any devotee of narrative nonfiction or lover of naval lore.An extraordinary tale.",book
"I absolutely loved The Wager. As my headline suggests, I consider this to be a BigDog book. What constitutes a ""BigDog"" book? It has to be the right combination of Information, Amusement and Never Being Able to Put it Down. David Grann did all three at a very high level. I think I love this guy, David Grann. He must have worked so damn hard on this book. The amount of scribbles and scrabbles he was probably trying to decipher from these dumb 250 year old ship logs! It must have been so tedious.But Grann did it. He went to work and researched the tits out of this story. And sure, there are certainly holes he must have approached in the story and realized that he would have to creatively fill those in. That, in my opinion, is to be expected. Not only did Grann fill those holes, he did it expertly and seamlessly. Do YOU know why we have the phrase ""3 Sheets To the Wind"" as a euphemism for being drunk? Well, throughout this history of the British man-o-wars, David Grann teaches you that there's more to being a shipman than knowing a few knots & phrases. It takes guts and sometimes, even honor.I won't spoil the story for you here. I believe the Amazon description above gives you even too much information and ""spoils"" as the kids say. Speaking of kids, my 14 year old son was watching me devour this book. He was the only one in my family willing to listen to the new things I'd learned about man-o-wars or ancient tribes while we all gathered at the dinner table. ""Did you know that the British Navy could just roll up on homies who had abandoned their ships and pretended to be dead so they didn't have to go back to sea? They called these guys 'Press Gangs.'"" Only my 14 year old would chirp up and say something positive like, ""That's awesome, dad!"" Or ""Do you think you could be a seaman, dad?"" What a nice boy.One day while I was cranking through the part of the book near the end that is sort of the political intrigue portion, my son said ""David Grann.""""What?"" I asked.""David Grann. The author."" My son was staring at the book jacket cover. ""I bet he's a real G.""I motioned for the kid to come over and when he sat next to me I said, ""A G? You better believe Grann is a G because he did all this freakin' research to make this book come to life. If that's not bein' a G, then I don't know what else is. Plus, take a look at this picture of him inside the book jacket!""He leaned in and looked at this picture of the most G-lookin dude of all time. David Grann, standing there with a polo shirt and jacket on top. Not really smiling, not really frowning. Just a look of a confident son of a bitch. My son was right: Grann is a real G. We looked at the picture and then my son read the little bio below, which is just his bonafides in the literary sense. We would have preferred David give us a little bit more personal stuff. For example, his favorite pizza topping would be a good choice to include. What about HIS favorite books instead of a list of books he wrote? I get it... his publisher only wants to pimp his books instead of other authors'. Still, give me a little flavor with Grann.Under his bio, there is his social media and website listed. Only his Twitter and Facebook handle. No instagram. I found that strange. You'd think there'd be a Wager Instagram handle at least! When I finished the book, I wanted to shout it out on my Instagram Story and let everyone know that David Grann is a G and he wrote a BigDog book. To my surprise, I found that Grann DID have an instagram page! I was shocked. Did one of his kids shame him into doing this? His publisher maybe? Regardless, my dude only has like 8 or 9 posts! And it's just pictures of the hardcopy of The Wager stacked on top of each other. I tagged this sad Instagram account to my hype Story about the book anyway. I thought it couldn't do harm.I recommend this book mightily if you couldn't tell.",book
"Grannâs Gift as a Story-Teller on Full DisplayIn the first half of the 18th century, Britain already had the most powerful navy in the world. But financing that navy was a huge burden on the Crown and England had not yet achieved the wealth that the industrial revolution and its own colonization efforts would later bring. The answer: intercept the gold and silver that Spanish ships were bringing home from its New World colonies.Author David Grann is able to tell not only this larger story but also to resurrect one of the most astonishing seafaring events of the time. A ship named âThe Wagerâ was to be part of a British fleet that would intercept gold-laden Spanish vessels in what was officially-sanctioned piracy. As the bookâs cover indicates, what then transpired was shipwreck, mutiny and murder. This is also the story of unexpected survival and efforts in an Admiralty court back in England to establish the truth of what happened.Life on board a ship at the time, so full of danger and disease that it was not unusual for as few as ten percent of the crew to survive a long voyage, meant that the Royal Navy had great difficulty manning its ships. Grann provides graphic descriptions of able-bodied and not-so-able-bodied men being kidnapped off the wharfs (âimpressedâ) to fill the complement of seamen just as a ship was about to sail. (Some years later the impressment of American seamen was a contributor to the War of 1812.)The hulls of wooden sailing ships had a very short life-span due to wood-eating worms, and were susceptible to leaks and other threats to seaworthiness. Scurvy could render entire crews incapable of functioning. Other communicable diseases could cause widespread death on board a crowded, ill-ventilated vessel.In the case of The Wager, the author was able to find a remarkable record of its 1740 voyage and of the events to come. This was in part due to the fact that on board as a junior officer was John Byron, a gentleman volunteer and a compulsive diarist. Incidentally, he was the grandfather of Lord Byron.Additionally, another major actor in the drama, John Bulkeley, had kept a voluminous diary which chronicled the events of the voyage. Buikeley held the position of Gunner, a crucial role in ship combat, and had many other responsibilities on board. He was an instinctive leader, physically imposing, who commanded respect.Finally, there was the record of the court-martial proceedings themselves, in which the main actors including David Cheap, the captain, provided their own version of events. Cheap was an ambitious, younger son of a Scottish Laird who, under the rules of primogeniture, did not inherit his fatherâs estate. He ran off to sea at 17 and set his sights on becoming a captain, which he realized when an opening occurred on The Wager.The Wager survived the perilous passage around the treacherous Cape Horn, only to run aground and break up on the rocks of an uninhabited island off Patagonia. There were no animals or other significant source of food on the island. The crew soon divided into two factions, one supporting Captain Cheap who wanted to build a vessel out of timbers salvaged from the shipwreck and continue up the Pacific coast of South America to engage Spanish ships. The other group was led by Buckeley, who wanted to build a vessel to return to England. The situation was so dire it would seem impossible that either group would survive.Improbably a few men did make their way back to England to be hailed as heroes. That is, until a second group, including Captain Cheap, also arrived. This forms the final chapter of the story of The Wager and the launch of an inquiry to establish the truth.Faced by death by hanging if they were found guilty of mutiny or of discipline if they failed their duty, each survivor told his story. âMembers of the Admiralty found themselves confounded by competing versions of events,â the author tells us. The result was unexpected, but only if one fails to consider that the leaders of an institution, in this case the Royal Navy, have as their first priority the preservation of that institution and the protection of its reputation.This is a wonderfully-written book and Grann is a masterful story teller.",book
"Iâm a fan of books about the age of sail, either fiction or non-fiction and âThe Wagerâ was an easy title to choose given the subject matter. In 1740 a Royal Navy squadron sets off on a secret mission to track down and capture a treasure laden Spanish galleon. While attempting to navigate the treacherous Cape Horn passage the HMS Wager is wrecked in severe weather off a desolate island on the Patagonian coast. What ensues is an astonishing tale of the marooned crew battling the harsh elements, starvation, and ultimately each other. Remarkably some of them survive and return to England with conflicting accounts of exactly happened to the ill-fated crew of the Wager. You have to admire the courage, tenacity, grit, and perseverance of individuals confronting such extreme adversity. Even the basic act of going to sea back then for months or years at a time required someone with exceptional intestinal fortitude. The skills and knowledge needed in those days to maneuver and navigate these complex sailing ships was considerable while bringing them into battle and defeating the enemy meant having a leader of incredible ability and luck. David Grannâs telling of the fate of âThe Wagerâ and her crew is masterfully done and hard to put down. The author meticulously researched this book and the amount of care he put into this work is obvious. For those who donât think they like reading âhistory booksâ Iâd suggest trying âThe Wagerâ because once you get sucked into the narrative youâll be turning the pages to find out what happens next to these unfortunate castaways. Iâm not sure what to make about some of the negative reviews I read here about the âlack of dialogââ¦this isnât a novel and there arenât any actual recordings of conversations that could be included. Itâs like complaining that there arenât any photos in the Bible. As a side note visiting an actual sailing ship of the era is an educational experience. The USS Constitution in Boston or the whaler Charles W. Morgan in Mystic, Connecticut gives you an idea of the conditions sailors like the ones on HMS Wager had to live with. If in the U.K. then a trip to Portsmouth (where our story begins) is highly recommended (give yourself a couple of days) and tour Horatio Nelsonâs flagship, HMS Victory to really get a feel for what a British âMan of Warâ was like from the 18th century.",book
"The Wager was an English ship that set sail from England in 1740 during an imperial war with Spain. It was the mid-1700s, and navigational tools were primitive. Diseases among the seafarers spread rapidly, and I was incredulous, realizing how little they knew about curbing nutritional deficiencies such as scurvy. It seems absurd that in addition to not knowing about the necessity for vitamin C, insufficient levels of niacin were causing psychosis and night blindness resulting from lack of Vitamin A. After shipwrecking on a desolate island off the coast of Patagonia, the story is as much about human nature as it is about surviving on an island and attaining its mission against the Spanish. It is fascinating to read about how they discovered new food sources and what they chose to learn and ignore from natives whose cultures had thrived in the areas where the Englishmen became castaways. If they were going to continue to survive and continue their naval mission, they had to build new boats without the technology available in their homeland, and there were myriad disagreements about how to proceed and also about which path to follow when it was time to embark on the dangerous waters again. Disharmony leads some groups to set sail in opposite directions eventually. When the survivors arrived back in England, the accounts of what happened were not in sync.The characters who are historical figures demonstrate the gamut of human emotions and an evolution of social mores. Without describing each character, Iâll point out that we meet a dominating captain with poor leadership traits. And, of course, we meet argumentative underlings who have smug independence. Then, we see ferocious workers and others with inherent leadership skills and charisma. All of the men are familiar with British naval order and ranking conventions. Yet, more hierarchies develop as the men struggle to survive and create social order. As the subtitle suggests, the fight for survival leads to becoming mutinous and murderous. Grann describes the basic human drives and terrors with admirable writing skills.Writing, in the eighteenth century, was an honorable thing to do. The men onboard the Wager kept written logsâsome were required, and others were kept to document some of the mutinous decisions. David Grann had copious notes and records to use when piecing this story together. Rousseau and Voltaire cited the Wagerâs expedition reports, as did Charles Darwin and Herman Melville. The seafaring journalists quote the Bible, poets, and famous writers. It is incredible how learned they were. Grann uses his well-honed investigative and research skills to weave a beautiful story of what reportedly happened and the eloquent analysis by those who experienced it. Grannâs ability to combine first-person accounts of the expedition with his summation of the events provides fabulous text about the seafarers and their exploits. Each creative, descriptive section title structures the book and shapes the voyage with metaphoric summaries: The Wooden World, Into the Storm, Castaways, Deliverance, and Judgment are the main sections, and Gran used these to develop the book so that it reads like a novel and keeps the reader riveted. I highly recommend this narrative to everyone, even those who prefer fiction to nonfiction.",book
"First of all, great book! If you like Eric Larson, you will certainly like David Grann. Well researched history wedded with the heart of a story teller. Nothing dry and dusty here. Other people have elaborated the merits so now for my main issue. Some people prefer to read without the interruption of footnotes. Some like to consider the additional information as they read. I am in this later category and my comment is for those who feel likewise. In formatting this book for Kindle, the publisher does not use numbered notations accessible in the main body of the text. When a reader has finished the last chapter, IF choosing to page through what follows, there are additional treasures, among these, the ""notes."" Supposing the reader scans through these, and finds something of interest? One can link BACK to the text ( and then, back to the ""notes), but there is no way to come upon the ""notes"" WHILE READING THE MAIN TEXT. I guess I just like a little more foot in my notes, thank you very much. I don't believe it's too obtrusive to have that little number woven into things. Readers who don't care for the diversion can just glide by, so what's the deal??? Sigh.Ok. One other ""noteworthy"" ( HeHeHe) item: I read this on a Fire tablet and on a Paperwhite and in the Paperwhite the pagination ended with the main text and ""book complete"" appeared instead. I'm not a fan of this. I get that some folks want credit for finishing a book without the hassle of paging through a host of addendums, but really, must the rest of us do without? Gaaaah!",book
"The Wager: A Tale of Shipwreck, Mutiny, and Murder. David Grann. Doubleday, 2023. 352 pages.On January 28, 1742, a thing that could very loosely have been called a boat - more like boat-ish, washed up on the shore of Brazil. On it were about thirty barely living men who had once been part of the crew of the British ship called The Wager that had left England in 1740 as part of a small fleet off to harass the Spanish in the so-called ""War of Jenkin's Ear"" or the War of Austrian Succession. They seemed to be all that was left of a crew of a couple of hundred, and they told the story of their wreck off the southern tip of South America, their survival on the desolate landscape for months, and their incredible 3000-mile-long voyage to Brazil. But, wait, there's more! Six months later an even sadder boat washed up on the coast of Chile, with just three inhabitants, including the ship's captain, and they added a new layer to the tale: murder and mutiny. When the survivors finally arrived back home in England, having been away from their loved ones for 4 or 5 years, accusations flew back and forth, various accounts were published, and the public was enthralled by the mystery and drama of what exactly had happened to The Wager and its crew.David Grann is the author of Killers of the Flower Moon, and he has established himself as one of the top writers of narrative nonfiction working today. His follow-up to Killers doesn't disappoint. The reader will learn a lot about life on a 1740s British warship and about how the command structure within the navy operated, but Grann also succeeds in bringing the men to life and telling their stories and how they dealt with their tragedy and hardships. Some men behaved more nobly than others, of course, but all suffered.Grann also relates the story of the shipwreck and subsequent court-martial to the bigger picture: empire. This incident occurred at the time that the British empire was really in ascendancy. The British performance in the War of Austrian Succession and the possibly embarrassing public spectacle of a high-profile mutiny trial might have had a major impact on Brittania's rule over the waves, and the world. Grann explores how all these big-picture ideas intersected with the very specific fears of some of the surviving crewmen that their careers and lives were at stake.",book
"David Grann has given us a marvelous book: it's a N.Y. Times Bestseller. The story follows the wreak of HMS Wager on the coast of Chile in 1741, the crew's mutiny, and the escape of both the surviving mutineers and ship's officers. Both groups made their separate ways back to London and astonished the public with their accusations and divergent stories. In the day mutineers were hung and Captains paid a price for losing their ship to the rocks (or to mutineers). The final resolution is London is a surprising twist to the whole affair. The book is easy to read and backed by extensive research, including photographs and maps. Strongly recommend it to readers attracted to great tales of the sea and strong men overcoming incredible obstacles.",book
"Have been reading sailing stories and this book came up with an excellent research job and studies of the journals kept. The Wager set sail from England in search of Spanish ships with which to do battle. But in those early times that meant sailing around the Cape at the tip of South America. Not an easy task and definitely not in those times. And it all goes wrong with the inhabitants of the ship suffering from scurvy affecting their vision and many other ailments. After hitting an island that barely qualifies as land with no real resources from which to feed the story really begins on survival and fighting amongst the crew. Amazingly they ""generally"" survive and attempt to sail away but not together and this is the story to read that I cannot share.Who will be blamed? Who was to blame? What are the consequences? how many survive? All great questions and well worth the read to finish the story.",book
"I really liked this work of narrative nonfiction. Every character in this true story is flawed, and acts badly under extreme stress. People will do very bad things when struggling to survive in dire conditions. The practices in the 18th Century British navy vs. what you would see today were barbaric. I read this on my Kindle Fire and there were no notes in the text. I also wondered as the story seemed to be winding down, how could I only be 50% through this book. It turns out notes, pictures, etc. took up half the length on Kindle! This book is extremely well researched, as it turns out. Although it was slow to get going, by the middle I was looking forward to reading every day after work. The author's writing style is very accessible. The characters are also very well drawn out. It was kind of confusing in the beginning when men were changing ships and the various captains. In reading nonfiction, often the denseness of the prose just becomes boring. Not so here. The story is very compelling. I was disappointed when it ended sooner that expected.",book

"Take a break from your dystopian novels and dive into the silly world of The Wonky Donkey. This little rhyming marvel chronicles the tale of - you guessed it - a donkey, but not just any old grey donkey - it's a donkey with character and description-defying eccentricities!Upon reading, you might find yourself inadvertently transforming into a Shakespearean actor putting forth an Oscar-worthy dramatic performance. Every line delivers a burst of laughter, and I found myself cackling like a hyena, much to the amusement (and perhaps a smidgen of worry) of my neighbors.The author clearly was high on fun and overtaken by a strange, compelling urge to create the quirkiest protagonist on four legs. As the donkey's description grows wackier, it challenges your tongue's flexibility. As I triumphantly navigated through phrases like a wonky, winky, honky-tonky, you can bet I had a bit of a workout for my jaws.An overall uproarious literary event, The Wonky Donkey does, however, have some peculiarities worthy of sharing in myPROS and CONS:PROS:1. Gut-busting humor: It's cheaper than a comedy club and you get a donkey!2. Lip Gymnastics: Forget facial yoga. Try reading this aloud!3. Kid-Friendly: Instant hit with the kids. Dining table or bedtime, Dearest Donkey reigns.CONS:1. Tongue Twister: Try saying ""wonky, winky, wonky, honky-tonky donkey"" three times fast.2. Wee bit repetitive: Yes, we get it. He is a wonky donkey!3. Advanced Vocabulary: Defogging instructions required on terms like 'honky-tonky'In conclusion, The Wonky Donkey sets off a laughing riot - in your heart, your belly, and possibly your whole town. Now, if you'll excuse me, I plan to thermal lift my spirits and tonify my tongue with another round of our beloved four-legged friend's adventures. Reader diversion ahead, proceed with giggles!",book
